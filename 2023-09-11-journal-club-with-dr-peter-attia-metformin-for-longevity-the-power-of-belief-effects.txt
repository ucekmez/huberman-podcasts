 welcome to the huberman Lab podcast where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and Ophthalmology at Stanford school of medicine today marks the first Journal Club episode between myself and Dr Peter attia for any of you that are not familiar with Dr Peter attia he is a medical doctor in MD who is an expert in all aspects of health and lifespan he is the author of a best-selling book entitled outlive which is a phenomenal resource on all things Health span and lifespan and he is the host of the very popular podcast the drive where he interviews various experts in all domains of medicine and scientists as well today Peter and I hold our first online collaborative Journal club for those of you that aren't familiar with what a journal Club is a journal Club is a common practice in graduate school and or medical school whereby students get together to discuss one or two papers to critique those papers and to really compare their own conclusions of those papers with the conclusions of the authors and to highlight any key takeaways Peter and I have been wanting to do a journal club together are for a very long time and we decided to do that journal club and to record it for you so today you will be sitting in on the first huberman Atia Journal club by the way it could just have easily been called the Atia huberman Journal club and we will discuss two papers first Peter is going to discuss a paper on Metformin which is a drug that many people are interested in for its potential role in longevity I want to highlight potential there he's going to compare that paper to previous findings on Metformin and by the end of that discussion he will advise as to whether or not he himself would take metformin and whether or not other people might be well advised or ill-advised to take Metformin based on the data in that paper and at this time then I present a paper which is about the placebo effect I have to imagine that most of you have heard of the placebo effect but what's interesting about the paper that we discussed today is that it shows that the placebo effect can actually follow a dose response so it's not just all or none it actually is the case that you can scale the degree of placebo effect depending on whether or not you're thinking you're taking low doses moderate doses or high doses of a particular drug and the particular drug that's discussed in the paper that I cover is nicotine so for those of you that are interested in cognitive enhancement by way of pharmacology or frankly for people who are simply interested in how our beliefs can shape our physiology I think you'll find that discussion to be very interesting so by the end of today's episode You Will Not only have learned about two novel sets of findings one in the realm of longevity as it relates to metformin and another in the realm of neurobiology and placebos or Placebo effects but you will also learn how a journal Club is conducted I think you'll see in observing how we parse these papers and discuss them even arguing in them at times that what scientists and clinicians do is they take a look at the existing peer-reviewed research and they look at that peer-reviewed research with a fresh eye asking does this paper really show know what it claims to show or not and in some cases the answer is yes and in other cases the answer is no what I know is for certain is that by the end of today's episode you will learn a lot of science you'll learn a lot about health practices some of which you may want to apply or avoid and you'll learn a lot about how science and medicine is carried out before we begin I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to Consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is Helix sleep Helix sleep makes customized mattresses to give you the best possible night's sleep now sleep is the foundation of mental health physical health and performance when we are sleeping well and enough mental health physical health and performance all stand to be at their best one of the key things to getting a great night's sleep is to make sure that your mattress is tailored to your unique sleep needs Helix sleep has a brief two minute quiz that if you go to their website you take that quiz and answer questions such as do you tend to sleep on your back your side or your stomach do you tend to run hot or cold in the middle of the night maybe you don't know the answers to those questions and that's fine at the end of that two-minute quiz they will match you to a mattress that's ideal for your sleep needs I sleep on the dusk at the usk mattress and when I started sleeping on a dust mattress about two years ago my sleep immediately improved so if you're interested in upgrading your mattress go to Helix sleep.com huberman take their two-minute sleep quiz and they'll match you to a customized mattress for you and you'll get up to 350 off any mattress order and two free pillows again if interested go to helixsleep.com huberman for up to 350 off and two free pillows today's episode is also brought To Us by levels levels is a program that lets you see how different foods and behaviors affect your health by giving you real-time feedback using a continuous glucose monitor one of the most important factors impacting your immediate and long-term health is the way that your body manages its blood glucose or sometimes referred to as blood sugar levels to maintain energy and focus throughout the day you want to keep your blood glucose steady without big Spa bikes or dips using levels you can monitor how different types of foods and different food combinations as well as food timing and things like exercise combined to impact your blood glucose levels I started using levels a little over a year ago and it gave me a lot of insight into how specific Foods were spiking my blood sugar and then leaving me feeling tired for several hours afterwards as well as how the spacing of exercise and my meals was impacting my overall energy and in doing so it really allowed me to optimize how I eat what I eat when I exercise and so on such that my blood glucose levels and energy levels are stable throughout the day if you're interested in learning more about levels and trying a continuous glucose monitor yourself go to levels.link huberman right now levels is offering an additional two free months of membership again that's levels.link l-i-n-k slash huberman to get two free months of membership and now for my journal Club discussion with Dr Peter attia Peter so good to have you here so great to be here my friend this is something that you and I have been wanting to do for a while and it's basically something that we do all the time which is to peruse the literature and find papers that we are excited about for whatever reason and oftentimes that will lead to a text dialogue or a phone call or both but this time we've opted to try talking about these papers that we find particularly exciting in real time for the first time as this podcast format first of all so that people can get some sense of why we're so excited about these papers we we do feel that people should know about these findings and second of all that it's an opportunity for people to learn how to dissect information and think about the papers they hear about in the news the papers they might download from PubMed if they're inclined but also just to start thinking like scientists and clinicians and get a better sense of what it looks like to pick through a paper The Good The Bad and The Ugly so we're flying a little blind here which is fun um I'm definitely excited for all the above reasons yeah no this is uh you and I have been talking about this for some time and and um you know actually we used to run a journal club inside the practice where once a month one person would um just pick a paper and you'd go through it in kind of a formal Journal Club presentation we've gotten away from it for the last year just because we've been a little stretched then I think it's something we need to resume because it's uh it's a great way to learn and it's a skill you know people probably ask you all the time because I know I get asked all the time hey what are the do's and don'ts of interpreting you know scientific papers is it enough to just read the abstract um and you know usually the answer is well no um but the how-to is is tougher and I think the two papers we've chosen today illustrate two opposite ends of the spectrum you know you're gonna obviously talk about something that we're going to probably get into the technical nature of the assays the limitations Etc and the paper ultimately I've chosen to present although I apologize I'm surprising you with this up until you know a few minutes ago is is actually a very straightforward simple epidemiologic paper that I think has important significance I had originally gone down the rabbit hole on a much more nuanced paper about ATP binding cassettes in cholesterol absorption But ultimately I thought this one might be more interesting to a broader audience by the way I got to tell you a funny story so I had a dream last night about you and um in this dream you were obsessed with making this certain drink that was like your Elixir and it had all of these crazy ingredients in it some tons of supplements in it but the one thing I remembered when I woke up because I forgot most of them I was really trying so hard to remember them one thing that you had in it was do like you had to collect a certain amount of dew off the leaves every morning to put into this drink it was so but it was like just sounds like something that I would do and and so but here's the best part you had you had like a thermos of this stuff that had to be with you everywhere and all of your clothing had to be tailored with a special pocket that you could put the thermos into so that you were never without the special Andrew drink and again you know how dreams when you're having them seem so logical and real and then you wake up and you're like doesn't even make sense like why would he want the thermos in his shirt like that I would warm it up like you know all these but but boy it was a realistic dream and there were lots of things in it including Dew special do off the leaves every morning I love it well it's not that far from reality I'm a big um fan of yerba mate I'm drinking it right now in fact um in its many forms usually the loose leaf I don't tend to drink it out of the gourd my dad's Argentine so that's where I picked it up I started drinking it when I was like five years old or younger which I don't recommend people do is heavily caffeinated don't drink the smoked versions either folks I think those are potentially carcinogenic but this thing that you describe of of carrying around the thermos close to the body if you are ever in Uruguay or if you ever spot grown men in a restaurant anywhere in the world carrying a thermos with them and to their meals and hugging it close chances are they're Uruguayan and they're drinking yerba mate they drink it usually after their meals supposed to be good for your digestion so it's not that far from from reality I don't carry the thermos but I do drink mate every day and um I'm gonna start collecting dew off the leaves uh just a few drops every morning oh my um some other time we can talk about dreams recently I've been doing some dream exploration I've had some absolutely transformative dreams for the first time in my life one dream in particular that has that allowed me to feel something I've never felt before and has catalyzed a large number of important decisions in a way that no other experience waking or sleep has ever impacted me and this was drug free Etc um and do you think you could have had that dream we don't have to get into it if you don't talk about it now but was there a lot of work you had to do to prepare for that dream to have taken place oh yes yeah um at least uh 18 months of intensive um analysis type work um with a very skilled psychiatrist but I wasn't trying to seed the dream yeah yeah it was just I I was at a sticking point with a certain process in my life and then I was taking a walk while waking and realized that my brain my subconscious was going to keep working on this I just decided it's going to keep working on it and then two nights later I traveled to a meeting in Aspen and I had the most profound dream ever where I was able to sense something and feel something I've always wanted to feel as so real within the dream woke up knew it was a dream and realized this is what people close to me that I respect have been talking about but I was able to feel it and therefore I can actually access this in my Waking Life it was it was it was absolutely transformative for me um anyway sometime I can share more details with you or the audience but for now maybe we should talk about these papers very well um who should go first I'm happy to go first this one's this one's this is a pretty straightforward paper so so we're going to talk about a paper titled reassessing the evidence of a survival advantage in type 2 diabetics treated with metformin compared with controls without diabetes a retrospective cohort study this is by Matthew Thomas Keyes and colleagues this was published last fall um why is this paper important so this paper is important because in 2014 uh banister published a paper that I think in many ways kind of got the world very excited about metformin so it was almost 10 years ago and I'm sure many people have heard about this paper even if they're not familiar with it but they've heard the concept of the paper and in many ways it's the paper that has led to the excitement around the potential for zero protection with metformin and I should probably just Define for the audience what Giro protection means when we think probably also sorry to interrupt what metformin is just for the uninformed that's a great point so I'll start with the with the latter so metformin is a drug that has been used for many years uh depends you know where it was first approved I think was in Europe um but you know call it directionally 50 plus years of use as a first line agent for patients with type 2 diabetes in the U.S maybe 40 plus years so this is a drug that's been around forever trade name glucophage or brand name and uh but but again it's you know it's a generic drug today the mechanism by which metformin works is debated hotly but what I think is not debated is the immediate thing that metformin does which is it inhibits complex one of the mitochondria so again maybe just taking a step back so the mitochondria as everybody thinks of those as the cellular engine for making ATP so the most efficient way that we make ATP is through oxidative phosphorylation where we take either fatty acid pieces or a breakdown product of glucose once it's partially metabolized to pyruvate we put that into an electron transport chain and we basically trade chemical energy for electrons that can then be used to make phosphates onto ADP so it's you know you think of everything you do eating is taking the chemical energy and food taking the energy that's in those bonds making electrical energy in the mitochondria those electrons pump a gradient that allow you to make ATP to give a sense of how Primal and important this is if you block that process completely you die so everybody's probably heard of cyanide right cyanide is something that is incredibly toxic even at the smallest doses cyanide is a complete Blocker of this process and if my memory serves me correctly I think it blocks complex four of the mitochondria I don't know if you recall if it complex three are complex four I know a lot about toxins that impact the nervous system but I don't know a lot about poison but if ever you want to have some fun we can talk about all the dangerous stuff that animals make and insects make and how they kill you yeah prototoxin and all these things that blocks I I really geek out on this stuff because it allows me to talk about Neuroscience animals and scary stuff it's like combines it so we could do that sometime for fun maybe at the end if we have a few moments so so you know something like cyanide that is a very potent inhibitor of this electron transport chain will kill you instantly people understand that of course a drop of Cyanide and you would you would be dead literally instantaneously yeah so metformin works at the first of those complexes I believe there are four if my memory serves correctly four electron transport chain complexes and um but of course it's not a complete inhibition of it it's just kind of a weak Blocker of that and the net effect of that is what so the net effect of that is that it changes the ratio of adenosine monophosphate to adenosine diphosphate um what's less clear is why does that have a benefit in diabetics because what it unambiguously does is reduces the amount of glucose that the liver puts out so hepatic glucose output is one of the fundamental problems that's happening in type 2 diabetes you may recall I think we talked about this even on a previous podcast you and I sitting here with normal blood sugar have about five grams of glucose in our total circulation that's it five grams think about how quickly the brain will go through that within minutes so the only thing that keeps Us Alive is our liver's ability to titrate out glucose and if it puts out too much for example if the glucose can if the glucose level was consistently two teaspoons you would have type 2 diabetes so the difference between being metabolically healthy and having you know profound type 2 diabetes is one teaspoon of glucose in your bloodstream so the ability of the liver to Tamp down on high glucose output is important metformin seems to do that so can I just ask oh one question is it fair um to provide this overly simplified summary of the biochemistry which is that when we eat the food is broken down but the breaking of bonds creates energy that then our cells can use in the form of ATP and the mitochondria are essential of that process and that metformin is partially short-circuiting the energy production process and so even though we are eating when we have metformin in our system presumably there is going to be less net glucose the bonds are going to be broken down we're chewing we're digesting but less of that is turned into blood sugar glucose well sort of I mean it's not um it's not depriving you of ultimately storing that energy what it's doing is changing the way the body um partitions fuel that's probably a better way to think about it to be a little bit more accurate so um for example like it's not depriving you of the calories that are in that glucose that would be you know fantastic but that was the that was the uh Electra remember the Electra from the 90s Electra folks for those of you don't remember um by the way if you ever ate this stuff you'd remember because it was a fat that was not easily digested it had sort of in sort of analogous to plant fiber or something like that so it was being put into potato chips and whatnot and the idea is that people would um would simply excrete it um and I don't know what happened except that people got a lot of stomach aches and um in the world we know that the anal seepage is what really did that product only a physician because after all Peter's a clinician for physician and MD and I'm not um could find it a um an appropriate term to describe yeah when you have that much when you have that much fat malabsorption you start to have accidents wow and so that did away with that product right it was either that or the diaper industry was trying to really take off okay that's why you don't hear about Electro that's right so so we've got this drug we've got this drug metformin it's considered a perfect First Line agent for people with type 2 diabetes so again what's happening when you have type 2 diabetes uh the primary insult probably occurs in the muscles and it is insulin resistance everybody hears that term what does it mean uh insulin is a peptide it binds to a receptor on a cell so let's just talk about it through the lens of the muscle because the muscle is responsible for most glucose disposal it gets glucose out of the circulation high glucose is toxic we have to put it away and we want to put most of it into our muscles that's where we store 75 to 80 percent of it when insulin binds to the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase is triggered inside so just ignore all that but a chemical reaction takes place inside the cell that leads to a phosphorylation so ATP donates a phosphate group and a transporter just think of like a little tunnel like a little straw goes up through the level of the cell and now glucose can freely flow in so I'm sure you've talked a lot about this with your audience things that move against gradients need pumps to move them things that move with gradients don't glucose is moving with its gradient into the cell it doesn't need active transport but it does need the transporter put there that requires the energy that's the job of insulin by the way I did not know that I mean I certainly know active and passive transport as it relates to like neurotransmitter and ion flow um but I'd never heard that when insulin binds to a cell that literally a little straw is placed into the membrane glucose doesn't need a pump to move it in um because there's much more glucose outside the cell than inside so it's just but the energy required is to move the straw up to the cell so biology is so cool yeah it is so so what happens is as and Gerald Shulman at Yale did the best work on elucidating this as the intramuscular fat increases and I by intramuscular I mean intracellular fat uh triasil and disoglycerides accumulate in a muscle cell that signal gets interrupted and all of a sudden I'm making these numbers up if you used to need two units of insulin to trigger the little transporter now you need three and then you need four and then you need five you need more and more insulin to get the thing up that is the definition of insulin resistance the cell is becoming resistant to the effect of insulin and therefore the early Mark of insulin resistance the canary in the coal mine is not an increase in glucose it's an increase in insulin so normal glycemia with hyperinsulinemia especially postprandial meaning after you eat hyperinsulinemia is the thing that tells you hey you're five ten years away from this being a real problem so fast forward many steps down the line someone with type 2 diabetes has long passed that system now not only are they insulin resistant where they just need a boatload of insulin which is made by the pancreas to get glucose out of the circulation but now that system's not even working well and now they're not getting glucose into the cell so now their glucose level is elevated and even though it's continually being chewed up and used up because again the brain alone would account for most of that glucose disposal the liver is now becoming insulin resistant as well and now the liver isn't able to regulate how much glucose to put into circulation and it's overdoing it so now you have too much glucose being pumped into the circulation by the liver and you have the muscles that can't dispose of it and it's really a vicious brutal Cascade because the same problem of fat accumulating in the muscle is now starting to happen in the pancreas and now the relatively few cells in the pancreas called beta cells that make insulin are undergoing inflammation due to the fat accumulation within the pancreas itself and so now the thing that you need to make more insulin is less effective at making insulin so ultimately way way way down the line a person with type 2 diabetes might actually even require insulin exogenously could you share with us a few of the causes of type 2 diabetes of insulin resistance I mean one it sounds like is accumulating too much fat yeah so energy imbalance would be an enormous one inactivity or insufficient activity is probably the single most of important so when Gerald Shulman was running clinical trials at Yale they would be recruiting undergrads to study obviously because you're typically recruiting young people and they would you know be doing these very detailed mechanistic studies where they would require actual tissue biopsies so you know you're going to biopsy somebody's quadriceps and actually look at what's happening in the muscle well I remember him telling me this when I interviewed him on my podcast he said the most important criteria of the people we interviewed is because they were still lean these weren't people that were overweight but they had to be inactive you couldn't have active people in these studies so exercising is one of the most important things you're going to do to ward off insulin resistance but there are other things that can cause insulin resistance sleep deprivation has a profound impact on insulin resistance I think we probably talked about this previously but if you you know some very elegant mechanistic studies where you sleep deprive people you know you let them only sleep for four hours for a week you'll reduce their glucose disposal by about half which is I mean that's a staggering amount you're basically inducing profound insulin resistance in just a week of sleep deprivation hypercortisolemia is another factor and then obviously energy imbalance so where when you're when you're accumulating excess energy when you're getting fatter if you start spilling that fat outside of the subcutaneous fat cells into the muscle into the liver into the pancreas all those things are exacerbating and got it okay so enter metformin first line drug so most of the drugs so every drug you give a person with type 2 diabetes is trying to address part of this chain so some of the drugs tell you to make more insulin that's that's one of the strategies so here are drugs like sulfona ureas they tell the body make more insulin other drugs like insulin just give you more of the insulin thing metformin tackles the problem elsewhere it tamps down glucose by addressing the glucose the hepatic glucose output channel glp-1 agonists are another drug they increase insulin sensitivity initially causing you to also make more insulin um so that's ozempic yes yeah and is it true that berberine is more or less the poor man's metformin yep okay yeah it's a from a tree bark it just happens to have these same properties yeah and by the way reducing mtor and reducing blood glucose yeah and Metformin by the way occurs from a lilac plant in France like that's where it was discovered so it's also metformin is also based on a substance found in nature so you you need a prescription for metformin you don't need a prescription for berberine correct but yeah we can talk about berberine a little bit later I had a couple great experiences with berberine and a couple bad experiences interesting or green yeah so um maybe taking one step back from this in 2011 I became very interested in metformin personally just reading about it obsessing over it and just somehow decided like I should be taking this so I actually began taking metformin I still remember exactly when I started I started it in May of 2011 and I realized that because I was on a trip with a bunch of buddies we went to the Berkshire Hathaway shareholder meeting which is uh you know the Buffett uh shareholder meeting and uh you know it was kind of like a fun thing to do and I remember being so sick the whole time because I didn't titrate up the dose of Metformin I just went straight to two grams a day which is kind of like the full dose and we went to this is that characteristic of your approach to things yes I think that's safe to say next time I'll give you a thermos of this Dew that I collect in the morning [Laughter] so I remember being so sick that the whole time we were in Nebraska or Omaha I guess I couldn't we went to Dairy Queen because you do all the Buffett things when you're there right like I couldn't have an ice cream at Dairy Queen you couldn't I mean I could I'm so nauseous oh because I would say if you've got metformin in your system you're going to buffer glucose you could have four ice cream cones except I couldn't put I couldn't keep anything down I mean I was so nauseous so so clearly metformin has this side effect initially which is a little bit of appetite suppression but regardless that's the story on Metformin there are a lot of reasons I was interested in it um I wasn't thinking true zero protection that term wasn't in my vernacular at the time but what I was thinking is hey this is going to help you buffer glucose better it's got to be better and this was sort of my first foray into you know self-experimentation do you want to Define zero protection yeah yeah it's a good term geriatric Giro yeah so so yeah Jiro from from geriatric old protection so protection from aging and when we talk about a drug like metformin or rapamycin or even NAD NR these things the idea is we're talking about them as Giro protective to signal that they are drugs that are not targeting a specific disease of Aging for example a pcsk9 inhibitor is sort of zero protective but it's targeting one specific pathway which is cardiovascular disease and dyslipidemia whereas the idea is a zero protective agent would Target Hallmarks of Aging there are nine Hallmarks of Aging please don't ask me to recite them I've never been able to get all nines straight but people know what we're talking about right so decreased autophagy increased senescence decreased nutrient sensing or defective nutrient sensing uh proteomic instability genomic instability methylation all of these things epigenetic changes those are all the nine Hallmarks of eight to seven yeah yeah so a zero protective agent would Target those deep down biologic Hallmarks of Aging and in 2014 a paper came out by banister that basically got the world focused on this problem by the world I mean the world of of anti-aging so what what banister and colleagues did was they took a registry from the UK and they got a set of patients who were on Metformin with type 2 diabetes but only metformin so these were people who had just progressed to diabetes they were not put on any other drug just metformin and then they found from the same registry a group of matched controls so this is a standard way that epidemiologic studies are done because again you don't have the luxury of doing the randomization so you're trying to account for all the biases that could Exist by saying we're going to take people who look just like that person with diabetes so can we match them for age sex socioeconomic status blood pressure BMI everything we can and then let's look at what happened to them over time now again this is all happening in the future so you're looking into the past it's retrospect in that sense and so let me just kind of pull up the the sort of table here so I can kind of walk through and this is not in the paper we talked about but I think this is an important background so they did something that at the time I didn't really notice I didn't notice what they did I probably did and I forgot but I didn't notice this until about five years ago when I went back and looked at the paper and they did something called um uh informative censoring so the way the study worked is if you were put on Metformin we're gonna follow you if you're not on Metformin we're going to follow you and we're going to track the number of deaths from any cause that occurred this is called all-cause mortality or ACM and it's really the gold standard in a trial of this nature or a study of this nature or even a clinical trial you want to know how much are people dying from anything because we're trying to prevent or delay death of all causes informative censoring says if a person who's on Metformin deviates from that inclusion criteria we will not count them in the final assessment so how are the ways that that can happen well one the person can be lost to follow up two they can just stop taking their metformin three and more commonly they can progress to needing a more significant drug so all of those patients were excluded from the study so think about that for a moment this is in my opinion a significant limitation of this study because what you're basically doing is saying we're only going to consider the patients who were on Metformin stayed on Metformin and never progressed through it and we're going to compare those to people who were not having type 2 diabetes so an analogy here would be imagine we're going to do a study of two groups that we think are almost identical one of them are smokers and the other are identical in every way but they're not smokers and we're going to follow them to see which ones get lung cancer but every time somebody dies in The Smoking group we stop counting them when you get to the end you're going to have a less significant view of the health status of that group so with that caveat the banister study found a very interesting result which was the crude death rate um was and by the way the way these are done this is also one of the challenges of epidemiology is the math gets much more complicated you have to normalize death rate for the amount of time you study the people so everything is normalized to thousand person years so the crude death rate in the group of people with type 2 diabetes who were on Metformin including the censoring was 14.4 so 14.4 deaths occurred per thousand patient years if you look at the control group it was 15.2 this was a startling result and I remember reading this in again 2014 and being like holy crap this is really amazing is there um could you explain why because I I hear those numbers and they don't seem that striking it's a difference of about a year and a half now of course um a difference of about a year and a half in lifespan is is well it is remarkable it doesn't even translate to that so so taking a step back type 2 diabetes on average will shorten your life by six years I see so that's the Actuarial difference between having type 2 diabetes and not all comers but you're right this is not a huge difference it's only a difference of a little less than one year of Life per thousand patient years studied okay and by the way up here just point out my my math was wrong when I said about a year and a half but but the point here is you would expect the people in the metformin group to have a far worse outcome I.E to have a far worse crude death rate and the fact that it was statistically significant in the other direction and it turned out on the What's called the Cox proportional Hazard which is where you actually model the difference in lifespan the people who took metformin and had diabetes had a 15 one five fifteen percent relative reduction in all-cause death over 2.8 years which was the median duration of follow-up well that seems to be the number that makes me go wow yeah right that um because could you repeat those numbers again yep so 15 reduction in all-cause mortality over 2.8 years that's a big deal it is and again there's no clear explanation for it unless you believe that metformin is doing something Beyond helping you lower blood glucose because the difference in blood glucose between these two people was still in favor of the non-diabetics so again the proponents of Metformin being a zero protective agent and I put myself in this category at one point I would put myself today in the category of undecided but at the time I very much believed this was a very good suggestion that metformin was doing other things you mentioned a couple already metformin is a weak inhibitor of mtor Metformin reduces inflammation metformin potentially tamps down on senescent cells and their secretory products you know there are lots of things metformin could be doing that are off Target and it might be that those things are conferring the advantage as many of you know I've been taking ag1 daily since 2012. so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast ag1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that's designed to meet all of your foundational nutrition needs now of course I try to get enough servings of vitamins and minerals through whole food sources that include vegetables and fruits every day but oftentimes I simply can't get enough servings but with ag1 I'm sure to get enough vitamins and minerals and the probiotics that I need and it also contains adaptogens to help buffer stress simply put I always feel better when I take ag1 I have more focus and energy and I sleep better and it also happens to taste great for all these reasons whenever I'm asked if you could take Just One supplement what would it be I answer ag1 if you'd like to try ag1 go to drinkag1.com huberman to claim a special offer they'll give you five free travel packs plus a year supply of vitamin D3 K2 again that's drink ag1.com huberman so fast forward until a year ago and I think most people took the banister study as kind of the best evidence we have for the benefits of metformin and I'm sure you've had lots of people come up to you and ask you should I be on Metformin should I be on Metformin I mean I probably get asked that question almost as much as I'm asked any question outside of do I mean people definitely want to know if you should be consuming do but but after that it's metformin fresh off the leaves has to be while viewing morning sunlight so okay so let's so let's kind of fast forward to now the paper that I wanted to spend a few more minutes on yeah and thanks for that background I I'm still uh dazzled by the uh insertion of the straw by way of of uh insulin I I don't think I've ever heard that described I need to I need to go get a better textbook it's a pretty Short Straw In fairness you know it's just it's just a little yeah just um to give people a sense of why I'm so dazzled by I am always fascinated by how quickly how efficiently and um how specifically biology can create these little protein complexes that do something really important I mean you're talking about an on-demand creation of a portal right I mean these are cells engineering their own Machinery in real time in response to chemical signals it's great yeah but I'm I'm sort of Rusty on my Neuroscience but an action potential Works in reverse the same way like you need the ATP gradient to restore the uh to restore the gradient but once the action potential fires it's passive outside right yeah so what peer's referring to is um the way that neurons become electrically activist by the flow of ions across the from the outside the cell to inside the cell and we have both active conductances mean they're triggered by electrical changes in the gradients Via changes in electrical potential um and then their passive gradients where things can just flow back and forth until there's a balance equal inside and outside the cell I think what's um what's different is that there's some movement of a lot of stuff inside of neurons when neurotransmitters like dopamine bind to its receptor and then a bunch of you know it's like a Bucket Brigade that gets kicked off internally but it's not often that you hear about receptors getting inserted into cells very quickly normally you have to go through a process of of you know transcribing genes and making sure that the specific proteins are made and then those are long slow things that take place over the course of many hours or days what you're talking about is a real on-demand insertion of a channel and it makes sense as to why that would be required but it's just oh so very cool it's cool yeah so keys and colleagues came along and said we would like to redo the entire banister analysis um and I I think their motivation for it was the interest in this topic is through the roof there is a clinical trial called the tame trial that is I think pretty much funded now and maybe getting underway soon the tame trial which is an important trial is going to try to ask this question prospectively and through random assignment so so this is the targeting aging with metformin trial that's correct okay near barzilla uh is probably the senior Pi on that um and I think in many ways the banister study along with some other studies um but of lesser significance probably provided some of the motivation for the tame trial so they said okay look we're going to do this we're going to use a different cohort of people so the first study that we just talked about the banister study used uh I believe it was like roughly they sampled like 95 000 subjects from a UK biobank here they used a larger sample they did about half a million people sampled from a Danish Health registry and they did something pretty elegant they created two groups to study so the first was just a standard replication of what banister did which was just a group of people with and without diabetic that they tried to match as perfectly as possible but then they did a second analysis in parallel with discordant twins so same-sex twins that only differed in that one had diabetes and one didn't I thought this was very elegant because here you have a degree of genetic similarity and you have similar environmental uh factors during childhood that might give you you know allow you to see if there's any sort of difference in signal so now turning this back into a little bit of a journal Club virtually any clinical paper you're going to read table one is the characteristics of the people in the study you always want to take a look at that so when I look at table one here you can see it's and by the way just for people watching this we're going to make all these papers and figures available so if you're you know don't you know we'll have nice show notes that'll make all this clear so table one in the keys paper shows the Baseline characteristics and again it's almost always going to be the first table in a paper usually the first figure in the paper is a study design it's usually a flow chart that says these are the inclusion criteria these are all the people that got excluded this is how we randomized Etc and you can see here that there are four columns so the the first two are The Singletons these are people who are not related and then the second two are the twins who are matched and you can see remember how I said they sampled about 500 000 people you can see the numbers so they got you know 7842 Singletons on Metformin the same number then they pulled out matched without diabetes on the twins they got 976 on Metformin with diabetes and then by definition 976 co-twins without them and you look at all these characteristics what was their age upon entry how many were men what was the year of indexing when we got them what medications were they on what was their highest level of Education marital status Etc the one thing I want to call out here that really cannot be matched in a study like this so this is a very important limitation is the medication so look at look at that column Andrew notice how pretty much everything else is perfectly matched until you get to the medication list yeah it's all over the place yeah it's just you it's not even close they're not where they're nowhere near matched right in other words just to give you a couple of examples right on the and let's just talk about The Singletons because it's basically the same story on the twins if you look at what fraction of the people with type 2 diabetes are on lipid lowering medication it's 45.6 percent versus 15.4 percent in the Matched without diabetes it's a 3X difference what about anti-platelet therapy that's 30 versus 14 antihypertensive 65 percent versus 63 versus 31 because people who have one health issue and are taking metformin are likely to have other health issues exactly so this is again a fundamental flaw of epidemiology you can never remove all the confounders this is why I became an experimental scientist so that we could control variables that's right because without random assignment you cannot control every variable now you'll see in a moment when we get into the analysis they go through three levels of corrections but they can never correct this medication one so just keep that in the back of your mind okay so the two big things that were done in this experiment or in this survey or you know study to differentiate it from banister was one the twin trick which I think is pretty cool the second thing that they did was they did a sensitivity analysis with and without informative censoring so one of the things they wanted to know is hey does it really matter if we don't count the metformin patients who progress so um so let's see kind of what what transcribed so the next figure figure two pardon me the next table table two walks you through the crude uh mortality rate in each of the groups so the most important row I think in this table is the one that says crude mortality per thousand person years now you recall that in the previous study in the banister study those were on the ballpark of about 15 per okay so let's look at each of these so in the um single The Singletons with without so the non-twins who were not diabetic it was 16.86 and could you put a little more Contour on what this thousand person years what what it is are you talking about pooling the lifespans of a of of a bunch of different people until you get to the number 1000 yeah because you're normalizing not so it's not who's going to live a thousand years because everyone's expecting that um you're essentially taking so you've got some people that are going to live um 76 years 52 years 91 years and you're pooling all of those until you hit a thousand and then that becomes kind of a a a it's like a normalized division you're basically like so let's say the the control group um you're asking if there were a thousand person years available to live How likely is it that this person would live another 15. yeah so a couple ways to think about it so taking a step back we always have to have some way of normalizing so when we talk about the mortality from a disease is like cancer in the population we would we report it as what's the mortality rate per and it's typically per 100 000 persons okay that's a much more intuitive way to express it it is but the reason we can do it that way is because we're literally looking at how many people died this calendar year and we divide it by the number of people in that age group so it's typically what you're doing when you look at aged groups in buckets of like decades so that's why we can say the highest mortality is like people 90 and up even though the absolute number of deaths is small it's because there's not that many people there right the majority of deaths in absolute terms probably occur in the seventh decade but as you go up because the denominator is shrinking you have to normalize to it so we just normalized the number of people here are all the people that started the year hear all the people that ended the year what's the death rate why are these done in a slightly more complicated way because we we don't follow these people for their whole lives we're only following them for a period of observation in this case roughly three years so to say something like you know we have a crude death rate of five deaths per thousand person years one way to think about that is if you had a thousand people and you followed them for one year you'd expect five to die if you had 500 people and you followed them for two years you expect five to die if you have a thousand people and you follow them for one year you expect five to die those would all be considered equivalent mortalities great thank you for clarifying that no no this this stuff is I mean like I find I find epidemiology when you get in the weeds is way more complicated than following the basics of um experimental stuff where you just you get to push all this stuff into the garbage bin and just say we're gonna take this number of people we're gonna exclude this group we're going to randomize we're going to see what happens yeah that's what like the paper we'll talk about next so when you adjust for age and they don't show it in this table it's only in the text when you adjust for age a very important check to do is what is the crude death rate of the people on Metformin who are not twins versus who are twins now in this table they look different because it's 24.93 for the metformin group and 21.68 for the twin group in that's on Metformin when you adjust for age they're almost identical it's it goes from 29 point 24.93 to 24.7 one other point I'll make here for people who are going to be looking at this table is you'll notice there are parentheses after every one of these numbers what is that what does that offer in there those parentheses are offering the 95 confidence interval so for example to take the number you know 24.93 is the crude death rate of how many people are dying who take Metformin what it's telling you is we're 95 confident that the actual number is between 23.23 and 26.64 if a 95 confidence interval does not cross the number zero it's statistically significant okay so the first thing that just jumps out at you I think when you look at this is there's clearly a difference here between the people who have diabetes and those who don't it complicates the study a little bit because it's basically two studies in one but you're comparing um 95 pardon me uh 24.93 to 16.86 which by the way remains after age adjustment when you go to the twin group it's 24.73 to 12.94 so maybe just to zoom out for that what you're describing if I understand correctly is this um uh crude deaths per 1000 person years let's just talk about The Singletons the non yes is 16.86 so 16.86 people die and some people probably think how can 0.86 of a person die well it's not always whole numbers but um there's a there's a bad joke to be made here but yeah just call it 17 versus 25 right 17 deaths per thousand versus 25 deaths yep and the 25 is in the folks that took metformin now that to the naive listener and to me means oh you know metformin basically kills you right um not a faster or you know you're more likely to die but we have to remember that these people have another they have a major health issue that the other group does not have that's right because people weren't assigned drug or not assigned drug it wasn't Placebo drug it's let's look at people taking this drug for a bad health issue and compare to everyone else that's right so now you have to go into and and I'll just sort of skip the next figure but the next figure is a Kaplan Meyer curve I I think it's actually worth looking at it because they show up in all sorts of studies so if you look at figure one it's a Kaplan Meyer curve which is a mortality curve so you'll see these in any study that is looking at death and this can be prospective randomized this can be retrospective but these are always going to show up and I think it's really worth understanding what a kaplan-meyer curve shows you so when the x-axis is always time and on the y-axis is always the cumulative survival so it's a curve that always goes from zero to one one or one hundred percent and it's always decreasing monotonically meaning it can only go down or stay flat it can never go back up so that's what a cumulative mortality curve looks like now we're looking at you're starting at alive and you're looking at how many people die for every year that passes that's right and in each curve there's one on the left which is the Matched Singletons and there's a one on the right which are the discordant twins you have two lines you have those that were on Metformin with type 2 diabetes and you have their matched controls and in this figure the Matched controls are the darker lines and the people with type 2 diabetes on Metformin that's the lighter line you'll also notice and I like the way they've done it here they've got shading around each one and we should mention for those that are just listening that in both of these graphs the downward trending line from the controls so again non-diabetic not taking metformin is above the line corresponding to the diabetics who are taking metformin um put crudely um the people who are taking metformin that have diabetes are dying at a faster rate for every single year exam and the two lines do not overlap except at the beginning when everyone's alive it's like a foot race where basically the people with metformin and diabetes are falling behind and dying as they fall that's right and I'm glad you brought up a good point it's not uncommon in treatments uh to see kaplan-meyer curbs cross they don't have to it's not a requirement that they never cross it's only a a requirement that they're monotonically decreasing or staying flat so I've seen cancer treatment drugs where they have like two drugs going head-to-head in a cancer treatment and like one starts out looking really really bad but then all of a sudden it kind of flattens well the other one goes bad and then it actually crosses and goes underneath but that's not the case here so to your point the people with diabetes taking metformin in both the match Singletons and the discordants are dropping much faster and they always stay below and I was just going to say that the shading is just showing you a 95 confidence interval so you're just putting basically error bars along this so if this were experimental data if you were doing an experiment with a group of mice and you were watching their survival and you were you know what you'd have error bars on this which you're actually measuring so this is because you have much more data here you're just showing this in this fashion for those that haven't um been familiarized statistics no problem um error bars correspond to like if you're just going to measure the heights of a room full of 10th graders there's going to be a range right you'll have the very tall kid and the and the Very uh shorter kid and you know the short kid and the medium kit and you'll and so there's a range there's gonna be an average a mean and then there'll be standard deviations and standard errors and um uh so these confidence intervals just give a sense of how much range you know some people um die die early some people dilate within a given year they're going to be different ages um so it these error bars can account for a lot of different forms of variability here you're talking about the variability is how many people in each group die we're not tracking one diabetic taking metformin versus a control I I should have asked this earlier earlier but well and it's also a mathematical model at this point too that's smoothing it out because notice it's running for the full eight years even though they're only following people for you know typically I think the median was like three or four years at a time so they're using this quite complicated type of mathematics called A Cox proportional Hazard which is what generates Hazard ratios and basically any model has to have some error in it and so they're basically saying this is the error so you could argue when you look at that figure we don't know exactly where the line is in there but we know it's in that shaded area if those shaded areas overlapped you couldn't really make the conclusion you wouldn't know for sure that one is different from the other yeah that's actually a good opportunity to um to uh raise a common myth which is a lot of people when they look at a paper let's say it's a bar graph you know um and they see these error bars and they will say people often think oh if the error bars overlap it's not a significant difference but if the error bars don't overlap meaning there's enough separation then that's a real and meaningful difference and that's not always the case it depends a lot on the form of the experiment um I often see some of the the more robust Twitter battles over you know how people are reading graphs and I think it's important to remember that um you run the statistics hopefully the correct statistics for the for the sample but determining significance whether or not the the result could be due to something other than chance of course your confidence in that increases as it becomes typically p-values P less than point zero zero zero zero one percent chance that it's due um chance right so very low probability P less than 0.05 tends to be the kind of gold standard cut off um but when you're talking about data like these which are repeated measures over time people are dropping out literally um over time you're saying they've modeled it to make predictions as to what would happen we're not necessarily looking at you know raw data points here yeah the raw data was in the previous table that's now taken and run through this Cox model and it's smoothed out got it and to your point about the bar graphs yeah I think the other thing you always want to understand is just because something doesn't achieve statistical significance the only way you can say it's not significant is you have to know what it was powered to detect um and statistical power is a very important concept that probably doesn't get discussed enough but before you do an experiment you have to have an expectation of what you believe the difference is between the groups and you have to determine the number of samples you will need to assess whether or not that difference is there or not so you use something it's called a power table and you you would go to the power table so if you if you're doing treatment a versus treatment B and you say look I think treatment a is going to have a 50 response and I think treatment B will have a 65 percent response you literally go to a power table that says 50 response 15 difference that gives you a place on the grid and I want to be 90 sure that I'm right so 90 power I'm being a little bit so there's going to be a statistician listening to this who's going to want to kill me but this is directionally the way we would describe it and that tells you this is how many animals or people you would need in this study you're going to need 147 in each group and by the way if you now do the experiment with 147 and you fail to find significance you can comfortably say there is no statistical difference at least up to that 15 percent there may be a difference at 10 but you weren't powered to look at 10 percent yeah and um very important point that you're making another Point that's just uh more General one about statistics in general the way to reduce variability in a data set is to increase sample size and that kind of makes sense right if you if I just walk into a 10th grade class and okay I'm going to measure height and I'd buy the first three kids that I see and I happen to look over there and it's the three that all play on the volleyball team together I my sample size is small and I'm likely to get a skewed representation in this case taller than average so increasing sample size tends to decrease variation so the that's why when you hear about a study from the UK biobank or from you know half a million Danish citizens like for instance in this study that's those are enormous sample sizes so even though this is uh not an experimental study it's an epidemiological observational study um there's tremendous Power by way of the enormous number of subjects and that's the way that epidemiology will make up for its deficit so you could never do a randomized assignment study on half a million people um you know so so epidemiology makes up for its biggest limitation which is it can never compensate for inherent biases by saying we can do infinite duration if we want like we could we could survey people over the course of their lives and we can have the biggest sample size possible because this is relatively cheap the cost of actually doing an experiment where you have tens of thousands of people is prohibitive I mean if you look at the women's health initiative which was a five-year study on I don't know what was it 50 000 women I mean was a billion dollar study so this is this is The Balancing Act between epidemiology and randomized prospective experiments and uh they so they both offer something but you just have to know their blind spots of each one I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge our sponsor inside tracker inside tracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you meet your health goals I'm a big believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long-term Health can only be analyzed from a quality blood test however with a lot of blood tests out there you get information back about blood lipids about hormones and so on but you don't know what to do with that information with inside tracker they have a personalized platform that makes it very easy to understand your data that is to understand what those lipids what those hormone levels etc mean and behavioral supplement nutrition and other protocols to adjust those numbers to bring them into the ranges that are ideal for your immediate and long-term Health Insight tracker's ultimate plan now includes measures of both APO B and of insulin which are key indicators of cardiovascular health and energy regulation if you'd like to try inside tracker you can visit insidetracker.com huberman to get 20 off any of inside trackers plans again that's inside tracker.com huberman to get 20 off so let's just kind of wrap this up I mean I think let's just go to table four which I think is the most important table um in in here which now lays out the the final results in terms of the hazard ratio so this is this is the way we want to really be thinking about this so again Hazard ratios um these are important things to understand a hazard ratio is a number and you always subtract one from the hazard ratio and that tells you if it's a positive number if it's a number sorry if it's a number greater than one you subtract one and that tells you the relative harm so if it has a ratio is 1.5 you subtract 1.5 is a 50 increase in Risk um if the number is negative you may recall on the banister paper the hazard ratio was 0.85 so if it's nothing so that means it's a 15 reduction in relative risk and here you can see all the hazard ratios are positive so what it's telling you here is and I'm going to walk through this because it's there's a lot of information packed here you've got Singletons you've got twins they're showing you three different ways that they do it they do an unadjusted model if you just look at The Singletons with and without metformin and you make no adjustments the hazard ratio is 1.48 meaning the people on Metformin had a 48 greater chance of dying in any given year than their non-diabetic counterpart the only reason I'm smiling it's not because I enjoy people dying quite quite to the contrary is that um this is novel for me that I've read some epidemiological studies before but it's not normally where I spend the majority of my time but up until now I was thinking okay people taking metformin are dying more more than those that aren't I just and I I'm just relieved to know that I wasn't um looking at all this backwards okay so they're dying more but of course we don't have a group that's taking metformin who doesn't have diabetes and we don't have a group um who uh has diabetes and you know is taking metformin plus something else so again we're only dealing with these constrained yeah now there's a lot of other arm to this study that I'm not getting into because it adds more complexity which is they also have another group that's got diabetes takes metformin and takes sulfona ureas which is a bigger drug and those people die even more whoa so which again speaks to the point right the more you need these medications they're never able to erase the effect of diabetes but in this case it seems that they might be accelerating possibly accelerating death due to diabetes possible we could never know that from this because we're we don't see we would need to see diabetics who don't take Metformin who take nothing and I would bet that they would do even worse so my intuition is that the metformin is helping but not helping nearly as much as we thought before so my point is they make another set of adjustments they say okay well look in the first one in the unadjusted model we only matched for age and gender okay that's pretty crude what if we adjust for the medications they're on the cardiovascular psychiatric pulmonary dementia meds and marital status I don't know why they threw marital status in there but they did I don't know maybe being married or unmarried I'm sure but it just seems like a random thing to throw in with all their meds I would have personally done that adjustment higher up but nevertheless if you do that all of a sudden the uh Hazard ratio drops from 1.48 to 1.32 which means yep you still have a 32 percent greater chance of dying in any given year all right what if we also adjust for the highest level of Education along with any of the other covariates well that doesn't really change it at all it ends up at 1.33 or a 33 chance increase in depth okay I always knew that more school wasn't going to save me was it's not doing jack so now let's do it for the twins if you do the twin study which you could argue is a slightly pure study because you at least have one genetic and environmental thing that you've attached the unadjusted model is brutal 2.15 that's a hundred and fifteen percent think about this these are twins who in theory are the same in every way except one has diabetes and one doesn't and the one with diabetes on Metformin still has 115 percent greater chance of dying than the non-diabetic co-twin when you make that first adjustment of all the meds and marital status you bring it down to a 70 increase in risk and when you throw education in it goes up to an 80 chance of risk now they did this really cool thing which was they did the analysis on with and without censoring so everything I just said here was based on no censoring tell me about censoring censoring is when you stop counting the metformin people who have died Okay so in the Singleton group when you unadjust it and the reason I'm doing the unadjusted is that's where they did the sensitivity analysis I don't think it really matters that much it's you just have to draw a line in the sand somewhere you'll recall that that was a 48 chance of increased mortality all-cause mortality if you stop counting if you if you apparently if you don't censor meaning if you include everybody including when people on Metformin with diabetes die if you censor them it comes down to 1.39 in other words this is a very important finding it did not undo the benefits that we saw in the banister study banister saw a 15 reduction in mortality when they censored when Keys censored it got better but not that much better it went from 48 to 39 in the twins it went from a hundred and fifteen percent down to only 97 percent so in some ways this presents a little bit of an enigma because it's not entirely clear to me having read these papers many times exactly why banister found such an outlined like such a different response there's another there's another technical detail of this paper which is they you can see on the right side of table four they did something called a nested case control but you'll see and I was going to go into a long explanation of what nested case controls are it's another pretty elegant way to do case control studies where you sample by year and you you you sort of normalize you you don't count all the cases at the end you count them one by one I don't think it's worth getting into Andrew because it doesn't change the answer you can see it changes it just slightly but it doesn't change the point the point here is the keys paper makes it undeniably clear that in that population there was no Advantage offered by metformin that undid the disadvantage of having type 2 diabetes this does not mean that metformin wasn't helping them because we don't know what these people would have been like without metformin it could be that this bought them a 50 reduction in relative mortality to where they'd been but what it says is in my way this is what you would have expected this is what you would have expected 10 years ago before the banister paper came out or maybe even before metformin was used because in some ways it's saying um what is the likelihood that sick people who are on a lot of medication are going to die compared to not sick people who aren't on a lot of medication yep wanna you know it's not quite that simple in the in the sense that as you said there are ways to um try and isolate the metformin contribution somewhat um because they're on a bunch of other meds um and presumably that was done and analyzed in in other figures that where they they can sort of try and they can never attach the results specifically to metformin right but um there must be some way of waiting the percentage that are on psychiatric meds or not on psychiatric medicine some way to tease out whether or not there's actually some contribution to metformin to this result well that's what they're doing in in be in the in the partial adjustment is they're actually com they're actually doing their best to say oh right married or not married they're going variable drug by drug all the way through high blood pressure non-high blood pressure smoking non-smoking Etc right and the way they would do that presumably is um by saying okay married not married that's why that's a simple one um are you on lipid lowering meds yes or no okay you are not you are not they and then comparing those groups yeah yeah okay so no no differences jumping out that can be purely explained by these other variables yes although again this is a this is a great opportunity to talk about why no matter how slick you are no matter how slick your model is you can't control for everything there's a reason that to my knowledge virtually every study that compares meat eaters to non-meat eaters finds an advantage amongst the non-meat eaters and we can talk about lifespan Advantage yes and we can or disease you know incidence uh studies and yeah it might be tempting to say well therefore eating meat is bad um Until you realize that it takes a lot of work to not eat meat that's a very very significant decision that a person for most people that's a very significant decision a person makes and for a person to make that decision they probably have a very high conviction about the benefit of that to their health and it is probably the case that they're making other changes with respect to their health as well that are a little more difficult to measure now there's a million other problems with that I picked a silly example because the whole meat discussion then gets into well you know when when we say eating meat what do we mean like this document is like deli meat versus grass-fed exactly you know a deer that you hunted with your bow how do we get into all those things but my point is it's very difficult to quantify some of the intangible differences and I think that even a study that goes to Great Lengths as this one does epidemiologically to make these Corrections can never make the corrections and so for me the big takeaway of this study is one this makes much more sense to me than the banister paper which never really made sense to me and again I was first critical of the banister paper in 2018 about four years after it came out that's about the time I stopped taking metformin by the way I stopped taking it for a different reason which we can talk about in a sec but um that was the first time I went back and said wait a minute this information this this informative censoring thing is that's a little fishy and I think we weren't looking at a true group of real type 2 diabetics now that said maybe it doesn't matter in other words maybe and even the keys paper doesn't tell us that metformin wouldn't be beneficial because it could be that those people if they were on nothing as their matched cohorts were on nothing would have been dying at you know a hazard ratio of three and this brought it down to 1.5 in which case you would say there is some zero protection there it is putting the brakes on this process all of this is to say absent a randomized control trial we will never know the answer has there been a randomized control trial not when it comes to a hard outcome now there has been in the ITP so the interventions testing program uh which is kind of the gold standard for animal uh studies which is run out of three Labs so it's it's an nih-funded program that's run out of three labs they um they basically test molecules for zero protection um the ITP was the first study that really put rapid mice on the map in 2009 that was the study that's fortuitously demonstrated that even when ravamycin was given very very late in life it was given to 60 month old mice it still afforded them a 15 uh lifespan extension has a similar style you've been done in humans I mean it's hard I mean it's a hard no I mean you can't really control with rapper mice no um but when the ITP studied metformin it did not succeed so the the there have not been that many drugs that have worked in the ITP the IDP is very rigorous right it's a it doesn't use an inbred strain of mice it is done concurrently in three Labs with very large sample sizing and so when something works in the ITP it's pretty exciting rapamycin has been studied several times it's always worked another one we should talk about at a subsequent time is 17 Alpha estradiol this continues to work in male mice and it produces comparable effects to rapamycin estrogen doesn't work in female rights but this is Alpha not beta so this is 17 Alpha estradiol not beta estradiol which is the estradiol that we all that is bioavailable in all of us and and uh just as a brief aside um I think you and I basically agree that um unless it's a problem males we're talking post-puberty um should try and have their estrogen as high as possible without having negative symptomology because of the importance of estrogen for libido for brain function tissue bone health bone health body because this idea of crushing estrogen and raising testosterone is just silly right there's not and let's just leave raising testosterone out of it but many of the approaches to raising testosterone that are pharmacologic in nature also raise estrogen a lot of people try and push down on estrogen and that is just again unless people are getting um hyperestrogenic effects like gynecomastia or other issues is the exact wrong direction to go you want estrogen estrogen is a very important hormone for men and women um canaga flows in an sglt2 inhibitor also very successful in the ITP but again interestingly rapid metformin not so metformin has failed in the ITP so you no longer taking metformin I stopped five years ago I mean you're not a diabetic so presumably you're taking I was taking it for a durable protection to buffer blood glucose yeah and ultimately potentially live longer yes exactly and the reason I stopped and this will be the last thing before we move on well because you couldn't go to the Dairy Queen at the Buffett event no finally the nausea went away after a few weeks or a month maybe um but once I got really into lactate testing I noticed how high my lactate was uh at rest so a resting fasted lactate should be in a healthy person should be below one like somewhere between 0.3.6 millimole and only when you start to exercise should lactate go up and in 2018 was when I started blood testing for my zone two so previously when I was doing zone two testing I was just going off my power meter and heart rate but this is when this is after I met Inigo San Milan and I started like wanting to use the lactate threshold of two millimole as my as my determinant of where to put my wattage on the bike and I'm like doing finger Pricks before I start and I'm like 1.6 millimole and I'm like what the hell is going on I can't be 1.6 but ran the a flight of stairs up the back of the Empire State Building well no that would put me a lot higher right but but and and being generous to your Fitness no but but but that's when I started digging a little digging and realized oh you know what this totally makes sense if you have a weak mitochondrial toxin what are you going to do you're gonna shunt more glucose into pyruvate and more pyruvate into lactate I'm I'm anaerobic yeah fuel source that's right so and then my zone two numbers just seemed off my lactation could you feel it sorry I didn't know can you feel it in your body because maybe now I'll just briefly describe I took berberine um I um During the period of maybe somewhere in the 2012 to 2015 stretch I don't recall what are you taking it for well I'll tell you so I I was and I still am a big fan of Tim ferriss's uh slow carbohydrate diet because I like to eat meat and vegetables and starches I'm an omnivore um and I found that it worked very quickly got me very lean I could exercise I could think I could sleep all you know a lot of my rationale for following one eating regimen or another what I eat is to enjoy myself but also have mental energy I mean because if I can't sleep at night I'm not going to replenish I'm not I don't replenish I'm gonna feel like garbage I don't care how lean I am or what you know um so I found the Slow Carb Diet to be um which was in the four hour body to be a very good plan for me it's pretty easy you drop some things like bread Etc you don't drink calories except after a resistance training session Etc but one day a week you have this so-called cheat day and on the cheat day anything goes and so I would eat you know eight croissants and then I'd alternate to sweet stuff and then I go to a piece and by the end of the day you don't want to look at an item of food at all so the only modification I made to this slow carb diet for our body thing was the day after the cheat day I wouldn't eat I would just fast and I had no problem doing that because it was just basically well since you said um uh what was it anal um analc was I did not have that but since you said that I um I won't up the ante here but I'll at least match your anal seepage comment by saying I had let's just call it profound gastric distress after eating like that the next day so the last thing you want to do is eat any food I'll just hydrate and oftentimes to try and get some exercise um and what I read was that berberine Poor Man's metformin could buffer blood glucose and in some ways make me feel less sick when ingesting all these calories in in many cases um spiking my my blood sugar and Insulin um because you're having ice cream and you know Etc and indeed it worked so if I took berberine and I don't recall the milligram count and then I ate you know 12 donuts I felt fine it was as if I had eaten one donut wow I felt sort of okay in my body and I felt much much better now um presumably because it's buffering the spikes in blood sugar I wasn't crashing in the afternoon nap and that whole thing and do you remember how much you were taking I think it was a couple hundred milligrams does that sound about right um there's a bright yellow capsule um I forget the source but in any case one thing I noticed was that if I took berberine and I did not ingest a profound number of carbohydrates very soon afterwards I got brutal headaches I think I was hypoglycemic I didn't measure it but I just felt I had headaches I didn't feel good and then I would eat a pizza or two and feel fine and so I realized that berberine was putting me on this kind of lower blood sugar state that was the logic anyway and it allowed me to eat these cheat Foods um but when I cycled off of the the four out because I I don't follow the slow carbide anymore although I might again at some point um when I stopped doing those cheat days uh I didn't have any reason to take the berberine and I feared that I wasn't ingesting enough carbohydrates in order to really justify trying to buffer my blood glucose also my blood glucose tends to be did you ever did you ever try a carbos no what is that so A carbos is another glucose disposal yeah it's actually a drug that but it works more in the gut and it just prevents glucose absorption uh a carbos is another one of those drugs that actually found a survival benefit in the ITP and it was a very interesting finding because the the thesis for testing it the ITP is a very clever system anybody can nominate a candidate to be tested then the you know the panel over there reviews it and they decide Yep this is interesting we'll go ahead and study it so when I think David Allison nominated uh a car bus to be studied the rationale was it would be a caloric restriction mimetic because you would literally just fail to absorb I don't know make up some number right 15 to 20 percent of your carbohydrates would not be absorbed and therefore you would the mice would effectively be calorically restricted it would pass them out that's right and what happened was really interesting one the mice lived longer on a carbos but two they didn't weigh any less so it what it they lived longer but not through calorie restriction that's interesting yes and it the the speculation is they lived longer because they had lower glucose in lower insulin and I don't want to send this down some rabbit holes here but there are all sorts of interesting ideas about um for instance that some forms of dementia might be so-called type 3 diabetes the diabetes of the brain and so things like berberine metformin lowering blood glucose ketogenic diets Etc might be beneficial there I mean there's a lot to explore here and I know you've explored a lot of that on your podcast I've done far less of that but well at least it seems that we know the following things for sure one you don't want insulin too high nor too low you don't want blood glucose too high nor too low if the buffering systems for that are disrupted clearly exercise meaning regular exercise is the best way to keep that system in check but in the absence of that tool or I would say in addition to that tool is there any glucose disposal agent because that's what we're talking about here metformin berberine a carbocy etc that you take on a regular basis because you have that much confidence in it the only one that I take is an sglt2 inhibitor um so this is a class of drug that is used by people with type 2 diabetes but which I don't have but because of my faith in the mechanistic studies of this drug coupled with its results in the ITP coupled with the human trial results that show profound benefit in non-diabetics taking it even for heart failure I think there's something very special about that drug I've actually that was another paper I was thinking about presenting this time maybe we'll do that the next time but do you believe in caloric restriction as a way to extend life or are you more of the do the right behaviors and that's covered in your book outlive and Elsewhere on your podcast um and buffer blood glucose is do you still obviously you believe in buffering blood glucose in addition to just doing all the right behaviors yeah I think you can uncouple a little bit the buffering of blood glucose from the caloric deficit so um I think you can be in a reasonable energy balance and buffer glucose with good sleep hygiene lots of exercise and just thoughtful eating without having to go into a calorie deficit so you know it's not entirely clear if profound caloric restriction would offer a survival advantage to humans even if it were tolerable to most which it's not right so for most people it's just kind of off the table right like if I said Andrew you need to eat 30 fewer calories for the rest of your life I'll live 30 fewer Years thank you yeah like there's just not many people who are willing to sign up for that so it's kind of a moot point um but the question is you know do you need to be fasting all the time do you need to be doing all of these other things and the answer appears to be outside of using them as tools to manage energy balance it's not clear right an energy balance probably plays a greater role in glucose homeostasis then from a nutrition standpoint then the individual constituents of the meal um now that's not entirely true like I can imagine a scenario where a person could be in a negative energy balance eating Twix bars all day and drinking you know big gulps but I also don't think that's a very sustainable thing to do because if by definition I'm going to put you in negative energy balance consuming that much crap I'm gonna destroy you like you're gonna feel so miserable you're going to be starving right you're not going to be satiated eating pure garbage and being in caloric deficit you're going to end up having to go into caloric excess so that's why it's an interesting thought experiment I don't think it's a very practical experiment for a person to be generally satiated and an energy balanced they're probably eating about the right stuff but I don't think that the specific macros matter as much as I used to think I'm a Believer in getting most of my nutrients from unprocessed or minimally processed sources simply because it allows me to eat Foods I like yeah and more of them and I just love to eat I I so physically enjoy the sensation of chewing that you know I'll just eat cucumber slices for prefer fun yeah right you know that's I mean that's not my only form of fun fortunately um this is an amazing paper um for the simple reason that it provides a wonderful tutorial of the benefits and drawbacks of this type of work and I think it's also wonderful because we hear a lot about metformin rapamycin and um these anti-aging approaches but I was not aware that there was any study of such a large population of people so it's pretty interesting yeah so I think it remains to be seen if and my patients often ask me hey should I be on Metformin and I give them a much much much much shorter version of what we just talked about and I say look if the tame study which should answer this question more definitively right this is taking a group of non-diabetics and randomizing them to Placebo versus metformin and studying for specific disease outcomes if the tame study ends up demonstrating that there is a zero protective benefit of Metformin I'll reconsider everything right so I think that's you know we just have to I think all walk around with an appropriate degree of humility around what we know and what we don't know but but I would say right now the epidemiology the animal data my own personal experience with its impact on my lactate production and exercise performance we could there's a whole other rabbit hole we could go down another time which is the impact on hypertrophy and strength which appears to be attenuated as well by metformin um you know I'll I'll I still prescribe it to patients all the time if they're insulin resistant for sure it's still a valuable drug but I don't think of it as a great tool for the person who's insulin sensitive and exercising a lot can't help but ask this question do you think there's any longevity benefit to short periods of caloric restriction um you know so for instance I decide to by the way I haven't done this but let's say I were to decide to you know fast and do a one meal a day type thing where I'm going to be in a slight caloric deficit you know 500 to 1000 calories for a couple of days and then go back to eating um the way that I eat before that short caloric restriction slash fast is there any benefit to it in terms of cellular Health can you you know so reset the system is there any idea that the the changes the clearing of senescent cells that we hear about autophagy that we you know that in the short term you can glean a lot of benefits and then go back to to your regular pattern of eating and then periodically you know once every couple of weeks or once a month just you know fast for a day or two is there any benefit to that that's that's purely in the domain of longevity not because there's all discipline function there there's a flexibility function there's probably an insulin sensitivity function but is there any evidence that it can help us live longer I think the short answer is no um for two reasons one I don't think that that duration would be sufficient if if one is going to take that approach but two um even if you went with something longer like what I used to do right I used to do seven days of water only per quarter three days per month so I was but I was basically always like it would be three day fast three day fast seven day fast just imagine doing that all year rotating rotating routing for many years I did that um now I certainly believed and to this day I would say I have no idea if that provided a benefit but my thesis was the downside of this is relatively circumscribed which is profound misery for a few days and what I didn't appreciate the time which I obviously now look back at and realize is muscle mass lost you're just it's very difficult to gain back the muscle cumulatively after all of that loss but my thought was exactly as you said like there's got to be a resetting of the system here this must be sufficiently long enough to trigger all of those systems but you're getting at a bigger problem with geoscience which I'm really hoping the epigenetic field comes to the rescue on it has not come close to it to date which is we don't have biomarkers around true metrics of Aging everything we have to date stinks so we're really good at using molecules or interventions for which we have biomarkers right like when you lift weights you can look at how much weight you're lifting you can look at your dexa scan and see how much muscle mass you're generating like those are biomarkers those are giving you outputs that say my input is good or my input needs to be modified when you take a sleep supplement you can look at your eight sleep and go oh my sleep is getting better like there's a biomarker um when you take Metformin when you take rapamycin when you fast we don't have a biomarker that gives us any insight into whether or not we're moving in the right direction and if we are are we taking enough just don't know so I I often get asked like what's the single most important topic you would want to see more research dollars put to in terms of this space and it's unquestionably this as unsexy as it is like who cares about biomarkers but like without them I don't think we're going to get great answers because you can't do most of the experiments you and I would dream up got it well I'm grateful that you're sitting across the table for me telling me all this and that um everyone can hear this but again we will put a link to the papers plural that Peter just described and for those of you that are listening and not watching um hopefully you were able to track the the general themes and takeaways and it is fun to go to these papers you see these big stacks of numbers and and it can be a little bit overwhelming but um my uh additional suggestion on parsing papers is notice that Peter said that he spent you know he's read it several times unlike a newspaper article or or a Instagram post with a paper you're not necessarily going to get it the first time you certainly won't get everything so that I I think spending some time with papers for me means reading it and then reading it again a little bit later or tell me yeah I was just about to say what's your because because I kind of have a way that I do it but I'm curious as to how you do it like if you're if you're encountering a paper for the first time what do you have an order in which you like to go through the do you want do you read it sequentially or do you look at the figures first I mean how do you how do you go through it yeah unless it's an area that I know very very well where I can you know Skip to some things um before reading it the whole way through um my process is always the same and actually this is fun because I used to teach a class when I was a professor at UC San Diego um called neural circuits and health and disease and it was an evening course that grew very quickly from 50 students to 400 plus students and we would do exactly this we would parse papers and um and I had everyone ask what I called the four questions um and it wasn't exactly four questions but I have a little three by five card next to me or a piece of main map by 11 paper typically and when I sit down with a paper I want to figure out what is the question they're asking what's the general question what's the specific question and I write down the question then what was the approach you know how did they test that question and sometimes that can get a bit detailed you can get into immunos chemistry and they did a you know PCR for this it it's not so important for most people that they understand every method but it is worthwhile that if you encounter a method like PCR or um you know chromatography or fmri that you at least look up on the Internet what its purpose is okay that will help a lot and then it was what they found and there you can usually figure out what they believe they found Anyway by reading the figure headers right what are you know figure one here's the header that typically if it's an experimental paper it will tell you what they want you to to think they found and then I tend to want to know the conclusion of the study and then this is really the key one and this is the one that would really distinguish the high performing students from the others you have to go back at the end and ask whether or not the conclusions the major conclusions drawn in the paper are really substantiated by what they found and what they did and that involves some thinking it involves really you know spending some time thinking about what what they identified now this isn't something that anyone can do straight off the bat it's a skill that you develop over time and different papers require different formats but those four questions really form the Cornerstone of teaching undergraduates and I think graduate students as well of how to read a paper and um again it's something that can be cultivated um and it's still how I approach papers so what I do typically is I'll read title abstract ice usually then we'll skip to the figures and see how much of it I can digest without reading the text and then go back and read the text but In fairness journals great journals like science like nature oftentimes will pack so much information in the cell press journals too into each figure and it's coded with no definition of the acronyms that almost always I'm into the introduction and results within a couple of minutes wondering what the hell This Acronym is or that acronym is and it's um it's just yeah it's just wild how much um how much nomenclature there really is I can't remember was it you or was it our friend Paul Conte when he was here um who said that oh no I'm sorry it was neither it was chair of Ophthalmology at Stanford uh Dr Jeffrey Goldberg who is a guest on the podcast recently who off camera I think it was told us that if you look at the total number of words and terms that a physician leaving Medical School owns in their mind and their vocabulary it's the equivalent of like 2 two additional full languages of fluency beyond their native language so you're trilingual at least I don't know do you speak a language other than English poorly okay so you're you're at least trilingual and probably more so no one is expected to be able to parse these papers the first time through without you know substantial training yeah no I I I think that's a that's a great format and you're absolutely right I have a different way that I do it when I'm familiar with the subject matter versus when I'm not uh well again if I'm reading papers that are something that I know really well I can basically glean everything I need to know from the figures um and then sometimes I'll just do a quick skim on methods but I don't need to read the discussion I don't need to read the intro I don't need to read anything else uh if it's something that I know less about then I usually do exactly what you say I try to start with the figures I usually end up generating more questions like what what do you mean what it how what is this how did they do that and then I got to go back and read methods typically and one of the other thing that's probably worth mentioning is a lot of papers these days have supplemental information that are not attached to the paper so um you're amazed at how much stuff gets put in the supplemental section and the reason for that of course is that the journals are very uh specific on the format and length of a paper so a lot of the times when you're submitting something you know like if you want to put any additional information in there it can't go in the main article it has to go in the supplemental figure so even for this paper there were a couple of the numbers I spouted off that I had to pull out of the supplemental paper for example when they did the sensitivity analysis on the um censoring versus non-censoring that that was in the supplemental figure that was actually not even in the paper we presented well should we change this other paper yeah it's a very different sort of paper it's an experimental paper where there's a manipulation I must say I love love love this paper and I don't often say that about papers I'm so excited about this paper for so many reasons but I want to give a couple of caveats up front first of all the paper is not published yet the only reason I was able to get this paper is because it's on bioarchive there's a new trend over the last I would say five six years of people posting the papers that they've submitted to journals for peer review online so that people can look at them prior to those papers being peer reviewed so there is a strong possibility that the final version of this paper which again we will provide a link to is going to look different maybe even quite a bit different than the one that we're going to discuss nonetheless there are a couple of things that make me confident in the data that we're about to talk about first of all the group that published this paper is really playing in their wheelhouse this is what they do and they publish a lot of really nice papers in this area um I'm going to mispronounce um her first name but I think it's chaosi goo at um who's at the econ School of Medicine Mount Sinai runs a laboratory there studying Addiction in humans and um the first off author of the paper is over Pearl this paper is wild and I'll just give you a couple of the takeaways first as a bit of a hook to hopefully uh entice people into listening further because this is an important paper this paper basically addresses how our beliefs about the drugs we take impacts how they affect us at a real level not just at a subjective level but at a biological level so just to back up a little bit a former guest on this podcast Dr Ali Crum whose name is actually Aaliyah crumb but she goes by Ali Crum talked about belief effects belief effects are different than Placebo effects Placebo effects are really just category effects it's okay I'm gonna give you this pill Peter and I'm going to tell you that this pill is molecule x5952 and that it's going to make your memory better and then I give you a memory test right and your group performs better than the people in the control group who I give a pill to and I say this is just a placebo or there are other variants on this where people will get a drug and you tell them it's Placebo they'll get a placebo you tell them it's drug it's it's a binary thing it's an on or off thing you're either in the drug group or the placebo group and you're either told that you're getting drug or Placebo and we know that Placebo effects exist in fact one of the crueler ones I was never the subject of this but there was kind of lore in high school that you know like kids would do this mean thing it's a form of bullying I really don't like it where you know they get some kid at a party to drink um alcohol-free beer and then that kid would start acting drunk and then they'd go gotcha you know it doesn't even have alcohol in it now that's a mean joke um and just reminds me of some of the the uh the horrors of high school maybe that's why I didn't go very often which I also don't suggest but no it um it's a mean joke but it speaks to the placebo effect right and there's also a social context effect so Placebo effects are real um we know this belief effects are different belief effects are not a or b Placebo or non Placebo belief effects have a lot of knowledge to enrich one's belief about a certain something that can shift their Psychology and Physiology one way or the other and I think the best examples of these really of these belief effects really do come from alichrom's Lab in the psychology department at Stanford although some of this work she did prior to getting to Stanford for instance if people are put into a group where they watch A Brief video just a few minutes of video about how stress really limits our performance let's say an archery or at mathematics or at music or at public speaking and then you test them in any of those domains or other domains in a stressful circumstance they perform less well okay and we know they perform less well because we're by virtue of a heightened stress response you can measure heart rate you can measure stroke volume of the heart you can measure um peripheral blood flow which goes down when people are stressed narrowing a vision Etc you take a different group of people and randomly assign them to another group where now they're being told that stress enhances performance it mobilizes resources it Narrows your vision such that you can perform tasks better Etc et cetera and their performance increases above a control group that receives just useless information or at least useless as it relates to the task so in both cases by the way the groups are being told the truth stress can be depleting or it can enhance performance but this is different than Placebo because now it's scaling according to the amount and the type of information that they're getting and can you give me a sense of magnitude of benefit or detriment that one could experience in a situation like the one you just described yeah so it's it's striking they're opposite in direction so the stress gets us worse makes you um let's say I think that if we were to just put a rough percentage on this it would be somewhere between 10 and 30 percent worse at performance than the control group and stress is enhancing is approximately equivalent Improvement so they're in opposite directions even more striking is the the studies that um Ali's lab did and others looking at for instance you give people a milkshake you tell it's a high calorie milkshake has a lot of nutrients and then you measure ghrelin secretion in the blood and ghrelin is a marker of hunger that increases the longer it's been since you've eaten and what you notice is that suppresses ghrelin to a great degree and for a long period of time you give another group a shake you tell them it's a low calorie Shake that it's got some nutrients in it but that doesn't have much fat not much sugar Etc they drink the shape less ghrelin's suppression and it's the same shape and it's the same Shake and satiety lines up with that also in that study and then the third one which is also pretty striking is they took hotel workers they give them a short tutorial or not informing them that moving around during the day and vacuuming and doing all that kind of thing is great it helps you lower your BMI which is great for your health you get you incentivize them and then you let them out into the wild of their everyday job you measure their activity levels the two groups don't differ they're doing roughly the same test leaning down cleaning out trash cans Etc guess what the group that was informed about the health benefits of exercise lose 12 percent more weight compared to the other group and no difference in actual movement apparently not now how could that be I mean literally this was sparked by in Ali's words you know this was sparked by her graduate advisor saying what if all the effects of exercise are Placebo right like which is which is not what anyone really believes but it's just such a you know I love that anecdote that Ali told us because it just really speaks to how like really smart people think they sit back and they go yeah like exercise obviously has benefits but like what if a lot of the benefits are that you tell yourself it's good for you and the Brain can actually activate these these mechanisms in the body and why wouldn't that be the case because the nervous system extends through both so so interesting so interesting Okay so fast forward to this study which is really about belief effects not Placebo effects and to make a long story short we know that nicotine Vaped smoked dipped or snuffed or these little Zin pouches or taken in capsule form does improve cognitive performance I'm not suggesting people run out and start doing any of those things I did a whole episode on nicotine the delivery device often will kill you some other way or is bad for you but it causes vasoconstriction which is also not good for certain people but nicotine is cognitive enhancing why well you have a couple sites in the brain namely in the basal forebrain nucleus basalus in the back of the brain structures like Locus ceruleus but also this what's called it's got a funny name the pedunculopontine nucleus which is this nucleus in the in the the pons in the back of the brain in the brain stem that sends those little axon wires into the thalamus the thalamus is a gateway for sensory information and in the thalamus the visual information the auditory information it has nicotinic receptors and when the pedunculopontine nucleus releases nicotine or when you ingest nicotine what it does is it increases the signal to noise of information coming in through your senses so the Fidelity of the signal that gets up to your cortex which is your conscious perception of those senses is increased and how much endogenous nicotine do we produce oh um well it's going to be acetylcholine bonding to nicotinic receptors I see we're not making nicotine we're not just binding so this is a this is a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor right of which there are at least seven and probably like 14 subtypes but um so right they're called nicotinic receptors in an annoying way in the same way that cannabinoid receptors are called cannabinoid receptors but then everyone thinks oh you know those receptors are there so because we're supposed to smoke pot or those receptors are there because we're supposed to ingest nicotine no the drugs that were used that's right right exactly receptor was named after the drug and so the important thing to know is that whether or not it's basal forebrain or predunculopontine nucleus or Locus ceruleus that at least in the brain because we're not talking about muscle where acetylcholine does something else via nicotinic receptors there in general it just tends to be a signal to noise enhancer and so for the non-engineering types out there no problem signal to noise just imagine I'm talking right now and there's a lot of static in the background there are two ways for you to be able to hear me more clearly we can reduce the static or I can increase the Fidelity the the volume and the clarity of what I'm saying okay um for instance and that's really what acetylcholine does that's why when people smoke a cigarette they get that boost of nicotine and they just feel clear it really works the other thing that happens is the thalamus sends information to a couple of places first of all it sends information to the reward centers of the brain the mesolympic reward pathway that releases dopamine and typically when nicotine is increased in our system dopamine goes up that's one of the reasons why nicotine is reinforcing we just like it it's a we seek it out I've done beautiful experiments with honeybees even where you know you put nicotine on certain plants or it comes from certain plants and they'll forage there more you get you know them kind of like buzzed that was upon bad pun um in any event there's also an output from this thing the thalamus to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex which is an area of the forebrain that really allows us to limit our focus and our attention for sake of learning it allows us to pay attention this is the circuit you talked about this in your fantastic podcast on stimulants yeah on ADH so ADHD typically ADHD drugs so things like Adderall Vyvanse methamphetamine for that matter um Ritalin yeah why it's counter-intuitive that a stimulant would be a treatment for someone with difficulty focusing yeah in young kids who have difficulty focusing if you give them something they love they're like a laser and the reason is that ventromedial prefrontal cortex circuit can engages when the kid is interested and engaged but kids with ADD ADHD tend to have a hard time engaging their mind for other types of tasks and other types of tasks are important for getting through life and it turns out that giving those stimulant drugs in many cases can enhance the function of that circuit and it can strengthen so that ideally the kids don't need the drugs in the long run although that's not often the way that it plays out and there are other ways to get at this you know there's now a big battle out there you know is ADHD real is it not real of course it's real does every kid need ADHD meds no are there other things like nutrition more play time outside Etc that can help improve their symptoms without drugs yes is the combination of all those things together known to be most beneficial yes are the dosages given too high and generally should be you know titrated down maybe some kids need a lot some kids need a little I probably just you know gained and lost a few enemies there so um the point is that um these circuits are hardwired circuits sorry one other question Andrew um if my memory serves correctly doesn't nicotine potentially have a calming effect as well and that seems a bit counterintuitive to the focusing one or the is it a dose effect or a timing effect how does that work yeah it's a dosing effect so the interesting thing about nicotine is that it can enhance focus in the brain but in the periphery it actually provides some muscle relaxation so it's kind of the perfect drug if you think about it again um it's it was reflecting on this how when we were growing up people would smoke on plane they had a smoking section on the plane you know people smoked all the time and now hardly anyone smokes but for all the obvious reasons but yeah it provides that really Ideal Balance between being alert but being mellow and relaxed in the body so um hence it's reinforcing properties okay this study is remarkable because what they did is they had people come into the laboratory they gave them a vape pen these are these are smokers so these are experienced smokers typically there's a washout before they come in so they're not smoking for a bit so they can clear their system of nicotine and they measure how long is that needed um typically it's a couple of days oh okay yeah um which must be miserable for those people you can't have Nicorette gum or anything no nothing they must be dying and I wonder how many cheat but they can measure they measure an oxide right they measure carbon dioxide and they're measuring nicotine in the blood as well so they do a good job there so then what they do is they have them vape and they're vaping either a low medium or high dose of nicotine the dosages don't really matter because tolerance varies Etc and then they are putting them into a functional magnetic resonance imaging machine so where they can look at it's really blood flow it's really hemodynamic response for those who want to know it's the oxygen it's the ratio of the oxygenated to deoxygenated blood because when blood blood will flow to neurons that are active to give it oxygen and then it's deoxygenated and then there's a change in what's called The Bold signal so fmri when you see these like hot spots in the brain is really just looking at blood flow and then there's some interesting physics around and I'll probably get this wrong but I'll take an attempt at it so that I get beat up a little bit by the physicists and Engineers do you remember the right hand rule yep right okay so do I have this right uh correct um the right hand rule if you put your thumb out with your first with your index finger your middle finger your thumb facing up I think that the thumb represents the charge the direction of the charge right and then isn't the electromagnetic field is the downward facing figure and then it's uh do I have that right um okay so someone will look it up but what you do is when you put a person's head in this big magnet and then you pulse the magnet what happens is the oxygenated and deoxygenated blood it interacts with the magnetic field differently and that difference in Signal can be detected and you can see that in the form of activated brain areas yeah I mean MRI all works by proton detection so presumably there's a difference in the proton signal when you have high oxygen versus low oxygen concentration yeah yeah that's right um and what they'll do is they'll pulse with the magnet because my understanding is that um and this is definitely getting beyond my expertise but that the the spin orientation of the protons then it's it's going to relax back at a different rate as well so by the relaxation at a different rate you can also get um not just resting state activation like oh look at a banana what areas of the brain light up but you can look at connectivity between areas and how one area is driving the activity of another area so very very powerful technique um so what they do is they put people in a scanner and then you'll like this because what are the what are the limitations of of fmri in terms of I mean how fine is the resolution I mean where are the blind spots of the technique so resolution you can get down to sub centimeter they talk about it always in these paper as a voxels which are these little cubic pixels um things um uh you know Sub sub centimeter but you're not going to get down to millimeter okay um there are a number of little compounds that maybe we won't go into now that have been basically worked out over the last 10 years by doing the following you can't just give somebody a stimulus compared to nothing I'll just tell you the experiment it was discovered for instance that when someone would move their right hand because when you're in the MRI and just went for one of these recently for a clinical not a problem but just for a diagnostic scan you're leaning back and you and you can move your right hand a bit and they would see an area in motor cortex lighting up but what they noticed was that the area corresponding to the left hand was also lighting up so what you really have to do is you have to look at resting state how much are they lighting up yeah and then subtract that out so now you'll always see resting state versus activation State yeah wasn't there a really funny study done as a spoof maybe a decade ago that put a dead salmon into an MRI machine and did an effect like they did an fmri of a dead salmon that demonstrated like some interesting signal no I didn't know that but but we got to find this one for the for the show notes we should do one of these wild papers ones there's there are papers of you know people putting don't do this folks putting elephants on LSD that were published in science and things like like crazy experiments we should definitely do a crazy experiments Journal Club um in any event you can get a sense of which brain areas are active and when with fairly high spatial resolution fairly high and pretty good temporal resolution on the order of hundreds of milliseconds not but it's not Ultra Ultra fast because a lot of neural transmission is happening on the you know tens of milliseconds especially when you're in talking about auditory processing okay so they put people into the scanner and then they they give them a essentially a task that's designed to engage the thalamus known to engage the thalamus reward centers and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and it's a very simple game you'll like this because um you have a background in finance you let people watch a market you know okay here's the stock market or you could say or the price of peas it doesn't really matter it goes up it goes down and they're looking at squiggle line then it stops and then they have the option but they have to pick one option they're either going to invest a certain number of the 100 units that you've given them or they can short it they can say oh it's going to go down and try and make money on the on the prediction it's going to go down you could explain shorting better than I could for sure so depending on whether or not they get the prediction right or wrong they get more points or they lose points and they're going to be rewarded in real money at the end of the experiment so this is going to engage this type of circuitry now remember these groups were given a vape pen prior to this where they've Vaped what they were told is either a low medium or high dose of nicotine and they do this task the goal is not to get them to perform better on the task the goal is to engage the specific brain areas that are relevant to this kind of error and reward type circuits and we know that this task does that so that includes the thalamus that includes the mesolympic reward pathway and dopamine it includes the ventral medial prefrontal cortex first of all they measure nicotine in the blood they are measuring how much people Vaped they were very careful about this one of the nice things about the vape pen for the sake of experiment and not recommending people Vape but they can measure how much nicotine is left in the vape pen before after they can measure how long they inhaled how long they held it in there's a lot that you can do that's harder to do with a cigarette okay they measured people's belief as to whether or not they got low medium or high amounts of nicotine and if they were told they were told they got either this is a low amount a medium amount or a high amount and then of course they looked at brain area activation during this task and what they found was very straightforward sorry they were all given the same amount yes this is this is the sneak I was going to offer it as a punch line but that's okay no I think that the the cool thing about this experiment is that the subjects are unaware that they all got the exact same amount of relatively low nicotine containing vape pen so they they basically and they're measuring it from their bloodstream so they all have fairly low levels of nicotine but one group was told you got a lot one group was told you got a medium amount and the other was told you got a little bit now a number of things happen but the most interesting things are the following first of all people's subjective feeling of being on the drug matches what they were told so if they were told hey this is a high amount of nicotine like yeah it feels like a high amount of nicotine and these are experienced smokers if it was a medium amount they're like man that feels like a medium amount if it's a low amount they think it was a low amount now that's perhaps not so surprising that's you just that's true Placebo yeah but if you look at the activation of the thalamus in the exact regions where you would predict acetylcholine transmission to impact the function of the thalamus so these include areas like What's called the centromedian nucleus the ventral posterior nucleus the names that really don't matter but these are areas involved in attention it scales with what they thought they got in the vape pen meaning if you were told that you got a low amount of nicotine you got a little bit of activation in these areas if you were told that you got a medium amount of nicotine and that's what you Vaped then you had medium amounts or moderate amounts of activation and if you were told you you got high amounts of nicotine you got a high degree of activation and the performance on the task Believe It or Not scales with it someone so keep in mind everyone got the exact same amount of nicotine in reality so here the belief effect isn't just changing what one subjectively experiences oh this is the effect of high nicotine or low nicotine it actually is changing the way that the brain responds to the belief and that to me is absolutely wild now there are a couple of other things that could have confounded this first of all it could have been that if you believe you got a lot of nicotine you're just faster where you're reading the lines better or your response time to hit the button is quicker you know I tell you you have a drug that's going to improve reaction time you might believe that about nicotine and so you're quicker on the trigger and you're getting they have a different activation more activation um there could be they rule that out they also rule out the possibility how to bid rule that out by looking at rates of of pressing and there was nothing and in sensory areas of the brain that would would um represent that kind of difference they don't see that the other thing that um is very clear is that the connection between the thalamus and the ventral medial prefrontal cortex that pathway scales in the most beautiful way such that people that were told they had smoked a low or Vaped a low amount of nicotine got a subtle activation of that pathway people that were told that they got a moderate amount of nicotine got a more robust activation of that pathway and the people that were told that they got a high amount of nicotine in The Vape Pen saw a very robust activation of the thalamus to this ventral prefrontal cortical pathway now of course this is all happening under the hood of the skull simply on the basis of what they were told and what they believe and technically the fmri is showing the activation of those two areas and that's how you can infer the strength of that connection that's right there's a separate method called diffuser tensor Imaging which was developed I believe out of the group in Minnesota Minnesota has a very robust group in terms of neuroimaging um that can measure activation and fiber Pathways this is not that but you can look at the timing of activation and it's a known what we call monosynaptic Pathway so we haven't talked so much about figures here but um I guess if we were going to look at any one figure um and I can just describe it for the audience that's not paying doesn't have the figure in front of them the uh let's see the the most um probably the most important figure is figure two remember I said I like to read the titles of figures which is that the belief about nicotine strength induced a dose dependent response in the thalamus basically if you and figure 2B um can tell you if they believe that they got more nicotine that's uh that's essentially the response that they that they saw so if you look or sorry panel e if you look at the belief rating as a function of the estimate in the thalamus of what how much activation there was it's a it's a mess when you look at all the dots at once but if you just separate it out by high medium and low you run the statistics what you find is that there's a gradual increase but a legitimate one from low to medium to high in other words if I tell you this is a high dose of nicotine your brain will react as if it's a high dose of nicotine now what they didn't do was give people zero nicotine I was about to say there's a control that's missing yeah right yeah so what they didn't do is give people zero nicotine and then tell them uh this is a high amount of nicotine sort of the equivalent of the cruel High School experiment no alcohol but then the the kid acts drunk now in the uh in the High School example it's unclear whether or not the kid actually felt drunk or not um it's unclear whether or not they had been drunk previously if they even knew what it would be like to feel drunk Etc and there's the social context what I find just outrageous and outrageously interesting about this study is simply that what we are told about the dose of a drug changes the way that our physiology responds to the dose of the drug and in and in my understanding this is the first study to ever look at dose dependence of belief effects right to really and why would that be important well for almost every study of drugs you look at a dose-dependent curve you look at zero low-dose medium dose high dose and here they they clearly are seeing a dose dependent response simply to the understanding of what they expect the drug ought to do in other words you can bypass pharmacology somewhat right now look at figure 2B am I reading this correctly so it's got um four bars on there you've got the group who we're told they got a low dose the group who was told they got a medium dose the group that was told they had a high dose and then these healthy controls right who presumably were non-smokers who were just put in the machine that's right yeah yeah this is measuring parameter estimate what is that referring to um their ability to play the the the the trading game uh the parameter estimate is the is the activation um reward related activities from independent to almost mask right so what they're doing is they're just saying if we just look at the thalamus what is the level of activation I see so this suggests that the only statistical difference was between the low and the high that's right and nobody else was statistically different that's right but that's not the whole story no that's not the whole story so when you look at the output from the thalamus to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex that's where you start to identify the is that figure four uh that is yes so this is where you see um so figure 4B if you look at parameter estimates so this is the degree of activation between the thalamus and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and it's called the instructed belief you can see that there's a low medium and high scatter of dots for each and that each one of those is significant so isn't it interesting that at the thalamus which is and you'll you'll immediately appreciate my stupidity when it comes to Neuroscience which is more proximate to the nicotinamide or nicotine that nicotinamide what do you call it the nicotine acetylcholine receptor you have a lower difference of signal strength and somehow that got Amplified as it made its way forward in the brain yeah does that surprise you it is surprising and it surprised them as well that the interpretation they give again as we're talking about before important to match their conclusions against what they actually found which is what we're doing here the interpretation that they give is that it doesn't take much nicotinic receptor occupancy in the thalamus to activate this pathway but they too were surprised that they could not detect a raw difference in the activation of Thalamus but in terms of its output to the prefrontal cortex that's when because that figure 4B is more convincing than figure two because even figure 2E if you read the fine print the r the correlation coefficient is 0.27 that's it's not that strong right it's weak so at the thalamus it's kind of like yeah there might be a signal by the way this goes back to our earlier discussion there could be a huge signal here and we're underpowered how many subjects were in this this you wouldn't have a lot of subjects in this experiment yeah this is no you it and this just speaks to the general challenge of doing this kind of work it's hard to get a lot of people in and through the scanner yeah it's expensive it's expensive uh we have to I should know this but we can um we can go back to the but you can sort of just look at the number of dots on here I mean it's in the low tens right it's like 40 30 something like that it's not so it's possible you do this with a Danish study yeah you do this with a thousand people this could all be statistically significant right it was um so they talk about this you know based on this we estimated that an N of 20 n a sample size in each belief condition the final sample would provide 90 power hour to detect an effect of this magnitude at an alpha of 0.0 0.5 and a two-tailed um test okay so that's that's them referring to what we just talked about which is the power we believe at 90 confidence to get an alpha of 0.05 which means we'll want to be 95 confidence we need 60 people 20 per group right yeah but if the difference is smaller than what they expected they'll miss out on some of the significance which that looks like they're missing between the medium and High group yep and I too was surprised that um they did not see a difference in the between the medium and the High group but they did in the output of the thalamus I was also surprised that they didn't see a difference this is kind of interesting in its own right if figure three talks about their belief about nicotine strength did not modulate the reward response the dopamine response how was that measured also just in fmri yeah exactly so if you look at figure 3B other people can't see it but basically oh yeah what you'll see is that there's no difference between these different groups um in terms of the amount amount of activation in these reward Pathways if people got a low medium or high amount of nicotine now that actually could be leveraged I believe if somebody were trying to quit nicotine for instance and they were going to do that by progressively reducing the amount of nicotine that they were taking but you told them that it was the same amount one from one day to the next you could Whittle it down to presumably to a low amount before taking it to zero and if they believed it to be a greater amount then it might actually not uh disrupt their reward Pathways meaning they would feel um presumably they'd feel rewarded by whatever nicotine they were bringing in what would be your prediction if this experiment were repeated but it was done exactly the same way with non-smokers well one thing that's sort of um interesting you asked about art potential sources of of artifact problems with fmri one of the challenges that they know in the study was you have to stay very still in the in the machine but the subjects were constantly coughing because they're smokers so okay so presumably the data would be higher Fidelity started chuckling at that one but I I was like I had to read that one twice oh that makes sense like there's smokers they're coughing they can't stay still so movement artifact um but in all seriousness I think that for people that are naive to nicotine even a small amount of nicotine is likely to get this pathway activated to such a great degree sort of like the first time effect of pretty much any drug but I wonder if they would be more or less susceptible to the belief system yeah that's a really good question right because they have no prior to compare it to they have no Pleasant they have no experience to compare it to with respect to the obviously beneficial effects of nicotine that the smokers are well used to so this is the the poor kid that got duped into thinking the non-alcoholic beer was at alcohol though they're actually the winner we know because I did an episode and alcohol alcohol is bad for you so in the end that kid wins and the other ones lose poetic justice but um that kid having never been actually drunk before presumably I would feel like they're being more susceptible that's my guess as well so you know my glee for this experiment is not or this paper rather is not because I think it's the be all end-all or it's a perfect experiment I just think it's so very cool that they're starting to explore dose dependence of belief because that has all sorts of implications I mean um use your imagination folks whether or not we're talking about um a drug we're talking about a behavioral intervention we're talking about a vaccine and I'm not referring to any one specific vaccine I'm just talking to vaccines generally I'm talking about psychoactive drugs I'm talking about illicit drugs I'm talking about antidepressants I'm talking about all the sorts of drugs we were talking about before metformin Etc just throw our arms around all of it what we believe about the effects of a drug presumably in addition to what we believe about how much we're taking and what those effects ought to be clearly are impacting at least the way that our brain reacts to to those drugs yeah it's very interesting I mean when you consider how many drugs that have peripheral effects um or peripheral outputs begin with Central issues so again I think the glp-1 agonists are such a great example yeah yeah um you know I don't think anybody fully understands exactly how they're working but it's hard to argue that they're impacting that the glp-1 analog is is having a central impact it's doing something in the brain that is leading to a reduction of appetite we believe that yeah yeah and I think the mouse data point to different areas of the hypothalamus that are related to satiety that that say it's at least possible yeah I mean that you know there's no quicker way to make a mouse overeat or under eat than by lesioning it's hypothalamus depending on where you do so so presumably these drugs work there but again it speaks to like what do you need to believe in order for that to be the case have they done Placebo trials there where people get something and they're told I mean of course those drugs have all been tested via Placebo and the placebo groups you know don't do anywhere near as well that's how we know that there's activity of the drug but but again there's you know that's a little bit different than being told you are absolutely getting it right because in the rcts you're just told you might be getting it you might not be getting it so it's not quite the same as this experiment this experiment is is one level up where you're being told no you're absolutely getting it you're just getting different doses of it yeah to take this to maybe the ADHD realm let's say a kid has been on ADHD meds for a while and the parents for whatever reason the physician decide they want to cut back on the dosage um but if they were to tell the kid it's the same dosage they've always been taking and it's had a certain positive effect for them according to the results at least in this paper which are not definitive but are interesting the lower dose may be as effective simply on the basis of belief and and this is the part that makes it so cool to me is that and it's not a kid tricking themselves or the parents tricking the kid so much as the brain activation is corresponding to the belief right so that's where this is this is why because it's done in the brain I think we can um you know it gets to these kind of abstract uh nearly mystical but not quite mystical aspects of belief effects which is that you know your brain is a prediction making machine it's a data interpretation machine but it's clear that one of the more important pieces of data are your beliefs about how these things impact you uh so it's not that this bypasses physiology people aren't deluding themselves the thalamus is behaving as if it's a high dose when it's the same dose as the low dose group wild yeah I mean I think of the implications for example with blood pressure right like we don't really understand essential hypertension which is the majority of people walking around with high blood pressure it's unclear ideology um so lots of people being treated how do we know that the belief system about it can't be changed and um yeah this is this is I don't know this is eye-opening yeah it's cool stuff and Ali crumb is on to some other really cool stuff like for instance um just to highlight where these belief effects are starting to show up if you tell a group that the side effects of a drug that they're taking are evidence that the drug really works for the purpose that they're taking it even though those side effects are kind of annoying people report the experiences less awful and they report more relief from the primary symptoms that they're trying to Target so our belief about what side effects are that's so interesting can really impact how quickly and how um compatible we feel about how quickly a drug Works excuse me and how compatible we feel that drug is with our entire life so maybe if we call them something else like not side effects but like additional benefits or something it's kind of crazy and you don't want to lie to people obviously but you also don't want to send yourself in the opposite direction which is reading the list of side effects of a drug and then developing all of those side effects um when and then maybe later coming to the understanding that some of those were raised through belief effects um we definitely see that that's the nocebo effect right that's that's the one we see a lot uh you know with all sorts of drugs and it's tough because you know how do you how do you know which is which and I think there are some people who are really impacted by that and it makes it very difficult for them to take any sort of pharmacologic agent because they basically they can't help but incur every possible side effect um is it or is it true that medical students often will start developing the symptoms of the different diseases that they're learning about is that true well you know I'll tell you I do think that in medical school you start to you start to think of the zebras more than the horses all the time you know like you know what I'm referring to right now you know you see Footprints you you see hoof prints you should think of horses but of course medical students you only think of the zebras there are some really funny things in medical school like there are certain conditions that you spend so much time thinking about that you have a very warped sense of their prevalence uh like in medical school there's this condition called sarcoidosis like we I feel like we never stop talking about sarcoidosis I've seen like three cases in my life right like it's just not that common um does it provide a great teaching tool or something I don't know like I just some of these things I don't know uh how much time did we spend talking about cytus and verses this is when people embryologically have a reversed rotation and everything in their body is flipped literally everything is flipped so their heart is on their right side their liver is on the left side their appendix is on the left side like and so I'm not making this up how common is this I've never seen it okay I was thinking about boxing in the liver shot like you could easily be going for the wrong side of the body no I swear to God like as a medical student if you were told someone had left-sided lower quadrant pain to which the answer is almost assuredly like they have diverticulitis you'd think they could have appendicitis in the context of cytus and versus like the fact that I would even register in the top 10 things that it could possibly be wow but yes you just have a totally warped sense of what's out there oh man well um this has been Pure Pleasure for me I don't know about yeah I don't know about our listeners but for me this is among the things that I just Delight in and and even more so because you're the one across the table for me teaching me about these incredible findings and and the gaps in those findings which are equally incredible because they're equally important to know about yeah so let's do this again in Austin absolutely next time on your home court very well and bring a little bit of that due if you've got it oh yeah yeah I'll bring a low medium and high low medium and higher thanks Peter you're the
