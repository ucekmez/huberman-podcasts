 welcome to the huberman Lab podcast where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday [Music] life I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and Opthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine recently the hubman Lab podcast hosted a live event at the ICC theater in Sydney Australia the event was called the brain body contract and featured a lecture followed by a question and answer session with the audience we wanted to make the question and answer session available to every one regardless if you could attend I also would like to thank the sponsors for the event they are eight sleep and ag1 eight sleep makes Smart mattress covers with cooling Heating and sleep tracking capacity now I've spoken many times before on this podcast about the fact that sleep is the critical foundation for mental health physical health and performance now one of the key things to getting the best possible night sleep is to control the temperature of your sleeping environment and that's because in order to fall and stay deeply asleep your body temperature actually needs to drop by about 1 to 3° and in order order to wake up feeling refreshed and alert your body temperature actually has to increase by about 1 to 3° eight sleep mattress covers make it extremely easy to control the temperature of your sleeping environment and thereby to control your core body temperature so that you fall and stay deeply asleep and wake up feeling your absolute best I've been sleeping on an eights Sleep mattress cover for about 3 years now and it has completely transformed the quality of my sleep for the better eight sleep recently launched their newest generation of pod cover the Pod 4 ultra the Pod 4 cover has improved cooling and heating capacity higher Fidelity sleep tracking technology and the Pod 4 cover has snoring detection that will automatically lift your head a few degrees to improve airflow and stop your snoring if you'd like to try an eights Sleep mattress cover you can go to 8sleep.com huberman to save $350 off their pod 4 ultra eight sleep currently ships to the USA Canada UK select countries in the EU and Australia again that's 8sleep.com huberman the other live event sponsor ag1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that also contains adaptogens and other critical micronutrients I've been taking ag1 daily since 2012 so I'm delighted that they decided to sponsor the live event I started taking ag1 and I still take ag1 once or twice a day because it gives me vitamins and minerals that I might not be getting enough of from Whole Foods that I eat as well as adaptogens and micronutrients those adaptogens and micronutrients are really critical because even though I strive to eat most of my foods from unprocessed or minimally processed Whole Foods it's it's often hard to do so especially when I'm traveling and especially when I'm busy so by drinking a packet of ag1 in the morning and often times also again in the afternoon or evening I'm ensuring that I'm getting everything I need I'm covering all of my foundational nutritional needs and I like so many other people that take ag1 regularly just report feeling better and that shouldn't be surprising because it supports gut health and of course gut health supports immune system health and brain health and it's supporting a ton of different cellular and organ processes that all interact with one another other so while certain supplements are really directed towards one specific outcome like sleeping better or being more alert ag1 really is foundational nutritional support it's really designed to support all of the systems of your brain and body that relate to mental health and physical health if you'd like to try ag1 you can go to drink a1.com huberman to claim a special offer they'll give you five free travel packs with your order plus a year supply of vitamin D3 K2 again that's drink a1.com huberman and now for the live event at the ICC theater in Sydney [Music] [Applause] [Music] Australia does having an afternoon sleep affect your quality of sleep at night um great question I can keep this one pretty brief um we just recorded a six episode series that will be aired later this year uh with the one and only Mighty Matt Walker who wrote The Marvelous book why we sleep and uh we went into this topic in depth the business of naps is the following keep them shorter than 90 minutes so you don't disrupt your nighttime sleep don't do them at all if it disrupts your nighttime sleep so if you're somebody that for whom even 10 minutes of napping disrupts your nighttime sleep don't do that if you're somebody who wakes up from naps feeling groggy that's what's called Sleep inertia this is what gave rise to the ever famous napino of having some coffee and then taking a nap or an espresso and then taking a nap again I get obsessed with gnomen clature why didn't they call it a Espress espresso nap I don't know naps are wonderful if they're shorter than 90 minutes don't interfere with nighttime sleep but I in particular am a big fan of as many of you know this business of non-sleep deep rest of putting the body into what body still mind awake and we know based on several studies from the University of Copenhagen that that actually replenishes levels of dopamine in certain key areas of the brain that restore mental and physical Vigor and do not disrupt nighttime sleep but rather enhance one's ability to fall and stay asleep or to fall back asleep so not only are these states of body still mind awake very beneficial it seems or I should say perhaps for creativity because that was all anak data but we know from real data from laboratory data on many subjects peer-reviewed Etc that body still mind alert is actually an effective means to improve one's sleep and perhaps even make up for sleep that one has lost so I encourage you if you're a napper great and if you have challenges with sleep in any way that you think might be related to your napping activity that you consider short 10minute or maybe 20 minute non-sleep deep breast protocols by the way they're completely zero cost and very soon we will be releasing to our YouTube clips Channel a 10minute 20 minute and 30 minute non-sleep deep rest protocol that I've narrated if you don't like my voice we can there are many out there of more pleasant voices but um what might be of particular interest to you is that the visual is of um the beautiful sunrise over Sydney so you know it'll bring you home as well um sunrises here absolutely spectacular do you believe in the placebo effect absolutely and there's probably a joke there but I can't come up with it on the Fly um how would I know if it's real that um something like that um so the placebo effect is real um our belief about what we've taken or what is happening to us has a powerful effect on our physiology it's not purely psychological the whole business of psychosomatic even that word is starting to fall away as we start to understand that our beliefs have a powerful effect on what happens to us physiologically so much so that for instance my colleague Ali Crum a tenar professor at Stanford's Department of psychology who's been a guest on the podcast who studies mindsets has done beautiful experiments on stress showing that if you watch a short video about stress and you learn all the terrible things that stress can do to your cognition your sleep and your well-being well that indeed that happens and that if you watch a short video about how stress can be performance- enhancing by sharpening your mental acuity your access to particular memory stores Etc that indeed that happens so-called belief effects why belief effects not Placebo effects well Placebo effects tend to be more General belief effects tend to be around specific types of information but the placebo effect has recently been shown to extend to a dose dependent placebo effect one of the more remarkable papers I think published in the last few years most people are unaware of I talked about this in a journal Club episode of The hubman Lab podcast with the one and only Peter Atia described a paper where people took either zero I believe it was .25 milligrams half a milligram or a gram of nicotine which is known to be a cognitive enhancer please don't smoke dip Huff or snuff nicotine that's erous in those forms but and taking nicotine can increase blood pressure Vasa constriction Etc but nicotine is a cognitive enhancer it is a cognitive enhancer and I can't help but tell you one story about this before I get back to placebo effect don't worry I always make my way back you can see why living with me as a child was so challenging um nicotine I was told by a very very famous Nobel laurate member M of the Neuroscience Community because I visited his office I won't tell you who it is at Columbia University I met with him and he was telling me about what he studies but I noed he chewed no fewer than six pieces of Nicorette during the course of that conversation and I had to just stop him at one point and say why are you consuming all this nicotine and he said well it's what's going to allow me to Stave off Parkinson's and Alzheimer's of course and I don't want to smoke and I said really and he said yeah there's some evidence that keeping levels of neuromodulators like dopamine acetylcholine elevated despite the increases in blood pressure that are caused by consuming nicotine May indeed offset Parkinson's and Alzheimer's I'm not telling you this as a clinical trial I'm telling you this as anic data he is a Nobel Prize winner he's still very very sharp in his 80s the point here is that in a study of nicotine and cognition where people's cognition is indeed enhanced by nicotine everybody knows that and agrees upon that people who were told they had a higher dose of nicotine performed better in this cognitive task when in fact they consumed zero and people who performed moderately who were then told that they had consumed a higher dose of nicotine performed better than those that simply consumed the moderate dose and were told they had a moderate dose in other words everyone gets the same dose either zero or moderate but depending on what you're told your performance changes accordingly and that's cool but what's really cool about the study is they actually recorded from brain centers of these individuals and the levels of activity in particular areas of the brain that are relevant for cognition changed according to what the people believe so there you go placebo effect is changing neural activity it's not all just through what you think is happening what you think is happening is the reflection of neural activity and then you go well of course but I think it's an important study so I believe in the placebo effect and it is dose dependent and that raises all sorts of scary concerns about the placebo effect but it's also pretty darn cool because what it means is that our belief system including our understanding of the mechanisms that are likely driving certain effects of drugs or protocols or what have you is going to play a powerful role in whether or not we get the effect that we want and perhaps that's the most important thing provided that you're going about it safely how do I enter the rest and digest State and exit my constant fight ORF flight State well the fastest way is going to be physiological size probably repeated two or three times in a row if you don't experience that the first time the second would be to combine that with panoramic Vision I must say and I don't want to sound like a like a repeating record here but there are certain things that if we're not doing on a regular basis our nervous system is just going to idle at a higher let's just call it autonomic RPM which is not you know real science language but if you've ever felt kind of wired and tired from lack of sleep you know what this is about the key thing is to get enough sleep each night you know so much so that I think we can safely say that stress is not bad for us provided you sleep well at night now the challenge is for most people including myself if you stress a lot sleep doesn't come easily or you wake from sleep in the middle of the night and here again is where zero cost behavioral protocols are truly in my opinion unless there's some dire clinical need the most effective and best practice and this non-sleep deep rest which by the way is indeed a renaming or a partial renaming of Yoga Nidra which stands for yoga sleep and again I have tremendous reverence for the yogic Traditions it's just that I had to make a decision a few years ago when I'd been introduced to Yoga Nidra in 2015 I was down at a trauma Treatment Center an addiction treatment Center in Florida run by a friend of mine essentially observing what they were doing with these addicts That Couldn't recover no matter what their effort and they were able to recover to get sober and stay sober and people were getting over other sorts of traumas through the use of many Protocols of course talk therapy Etc but they would start their day with 30 minutes to an hour of yoga NRA and I thought what's Yoga Nidra learned its yoga sleep you lie down you do a self-directed relaxation it also involves intentions Etc and I thought this is really powerful and I spent a lot of time in my laboratory working on it and understanding it and there are other studies as well that now explain how these states of keeping the Mind active while the body is still as a self-directed practice is immensely powerful for a number of reasons and the reason I decide to call it non-sleep deep rest nsdr was not to rob it of the official name of yoganidra but because unfortunately unfortunately names like yoganidra or proprietary names or thing when we name protocols after people it acts as a separator it often deters people from trying things because it sounds esoteric so I went with a description of the thing that relates to what the thing is supposed to do non-sleep deep rest or what it's all about so um you know I actively avoided calling it huberman breathing um or something like that because that's not my interest my interest is in people using these tools and I have taken some heat for that one um I'm not interested it was not an attempt to appropriate something it was really an attempt to just try and distribute valuable tools because I see a lot of suffering and it seems like a useful thing to do so I would encourage anyone that feels like they enter a stressed State too much to learn self-directed relaxation first and foremost so do nsdr anywhere from three to five times a week 10 minutes a day as a zero cost tool as a way to be able to better access better sleep at night and then if the figh ORF flight State persists then of course things like physiological SI Etc um should be incorporated and then of course of course of course I believe in modern medicine there are excellent pharmaceutical tools prescription drugs that can be used for that but of course there's the intermediate stuff things like theanine and magnesium that you know for all the world can be useful in some context but they're not the be all end all you know as much as I might reference supplements on the podcast from time to time I don't think they're the place to start I think one should always use behavioral tools first and I've said this many times before um but I think it's worth saying again our muscles need rest days from the gym in order to grow back stronger yes definitely true um is the brain designed to be consistently learning and developing or does does it need periods of rest from consuming new information or is the rest when we sleep great questions thank you Timothy um yes indeed our muscles get stronger grow after a proper stimulus is applied to them in the time after we provide that stimulus which typically is resistance but since not everyone's interested in that it's also the case that an endurance adaptation occurs after we embark on the run the hike the swim Etc there's something kind of interesting and I just want to take a moment and just um mention that there's something kind of interesting about resistance training is that the one form of training that because of the enhanced blood flow to the muscles while we do it gives us a window into what the adaptation might look like once it occurs if we allow proper rest whereas with endurance training it's very different right you go further and or you run up a hill until your legs burn and you want to vomit up a and then the next time you do it you don't feel quite as bad right the adaptation occurs of course in a very similar way to resistance training different mechanisms but there's a delay and adaptation you get better it's just that with resistance training you can kind of sense the change before the change occurs because of the enhanced blood flow of the muscles with endurance training you sense the limit of your ability and then you exceed that limit subsequently now in terms of cognitive learning the same thing is basically true if you want to get really technical about it the computational biology the modeling of this says that if you want to learn something probably setting the difficulty of what you're trying to learn to about 85% correct trials 15% error trials is probably ideal what does that mean it means if you're trying to learn a new piano piece you know or you're trying to teach that to a child if they're not starting from scratch let them play something that they know pretty well and then introduce a small percentage maybe 10 to 15 maybe 20% you don't have to be exact about this of Novel material that's hard for them to learn but yes it is the focused deliberate attempt to learn something that creates that sense of underlying agitation that is the trigger the stimulus for neuroplasticity this makes sense if you could complete something if you could do something a scale on of Music a physical task speaking a new language if you could do that why would your nervous system ever change and how does your nervous system know if it's supposed to change right your nervous system doesn't know successful trial versus failure trial right I've tried many times to learn other languages and I'm you know modestly terrible at Spanish but if I were to try and get better my nervous system doesn't know when I'm failing has no idea what it knows is the release of certain neurom modulators namely adrenaline and norepinephrine and a few others as well that are associated with the underlying agitation of like I'm failing at this I'm not able to remember that Spanish class because I didn't attend in high school and this is really difficult and that agitation the frustration is the stimulus but when we say frustration it's the neurochemicals that when they bathe the surrounding neurons those neurons go oh something needs to change for next time and lo and behold the stimulus for neuroplasticity has occurred but the actual rewiring of the neurons either the Improvement or the reduction in the strength of synapsis of connections between neurons and in rare instances the addition of new neurons for neuroplasticity occurs yes when we sleep in states of deep rest or non-sleep deep rest although there's less data to support that but the actual rewiring occurs away from the stimulus so there's really two important principles here one is that agitation and stress and the neurochemicals that underly agitation and stress that is the stimulus for Learning and goodness do I wish they had taught me that in school I mean they taught me all sorts of things in school but they didn't teach me that they didn't teach me the physiological side Lord knows I would have done better in life if I had those tools instead they told me look you know if you drive drunk you could die that was good information but they didn't tell us about all the other stuff so I wish they told us about the stimulus and rest thing and somehow they have permission to talk about the rest all right what's my take on hallucinations goodness gracious my take on hallucinations is um I've taken them um clearly um well here's the the real story on Hallin first of all um I'm I'm very open about most everything I've done you know um trying to keep context appropriate but um I I had the unfortunate experience of taking LSD and Sil sibin when I was all too young and those were bad experiences some of them were bad in the moment some of them were bad after the moment it is something I do not recommend and I'm not saying that to be politically correct I'm not saying that because it's true the reality is that being a child an adolescent or a teenager is a psychedelic experience and your brain is still wiring up in all sorts of interesting ways and everything seems chaotic and even if you're one of those rare kids that seems to have everything roded up appropriately you don't want to throw massive amounts of neuromodulators in there haphazardly and start tampering with the wiring that's my deep belief okay you that's my deep belief however it does appear that at least for adults who are not suffering from particular psychiatric challenges namely forms of psychosis right this is real I mean one in 100 people experiences schizophrenic symptoms Etc it's a very high number if you think about it um certain forms of bipolar depression that the clinical trials on psychedelics and here I'm assuming when you say hallucinogens you're referring to psychedelics are very very compelling the psychiatric Community is now being forced to look at these data because the data are very compelling what do we know about these data and yes I've participated in two such clinical trials one on high do psilocybin high dose meaning more than two grams taken twice by the way this is with the support of medically trained therapists and the use of psychedelics such as psilocybin mostly psilocybin not so much LSD do you know why most of the trials are on psilocybin and not LSD I do but I'm curious if you know it's not to what's that LSD is too long that's right that people need to go home people need to go home the technicians need to go and LSD is a long ride it's a long ride so the the thing about cybin is that the you know the sort of Journey the trip is you know somewhere on the order of anywhere from you know 3 to 7 hours which can fit into a reason able work day for a technician clinician um and LSD can be many many hours longer the kind of um Mount Everest of psychedelics which is under investigation by a colleague of mine at Stanford School of Medicine Nolan Williams is ibigan iboga which is 22 hours long it has cardiac effects this is not something to to get Cavalier with this is something only to be done in a clinical context with medical experts there and iboga is very interesting from what I'm told I have not participated in iboga trial iboga allows for or induces a state in which you do not hallucinate at all with eyes open but the moment you go eyes closed you get a highresolution accurate picture of Prior events in your life but you have agency you have volition inside of those pictures and you're able to change your behavior and resculpt your Rel relationship to those experiences like wow and the state of Kentucky in California recently excuse me the state of Kentucky in the United States thank goodness Kentucky isn't inside of California that would be civil war the state of Kentucky recently took the $40 million settlement from the opioid thing right you've all heard about that the opioid crisis and applied that money to iboga trials so this stuff is happening this stuff is really happening now in the US in any event psilocybin these two sessions medically supported two sessions um has been shown to be pretty effective in the treatment of major depression not completely effective sometimes there's adverse outcomes but far more effective than the other pharmaceutical treatments that it's been compared to so that's interesting and psilocybin is serotonin if you look at the structure of psilocybin and it looks like serotonin so we're talking about is a massive dose of Serotonin and psilocybin appears to bind near selectively to a particular serotonin receptor and the outcome seems to be enhanced or more more broad connectivity between brain areas that normally are not communicating with one another probably not the growth of new connections but the let's say the unveiling of the ability for certain brain areas to communicate with with one another whereas they couldn't prior different ways of thinking about the same problems which is logically sound if you think about ways to deal with depression depression is characterized by a number of things of course but one of the Hallmark features of depression in addition to sleep challenges is a lack of positive anticipation of the future and it does seem that these macro do cocin trials are helpful for that turns out that the micro doing of psilocybin has not been shown to be Terri effective which is not to say it isn't but the trials don't support that although there aren't many Trials of that yet so it appears you know if you had to pick between micro and macro dosing go macro um but be careful um go be careful and and set in setting is important safety is important and certainly not for children and as long as and or adolescence or teenagers I really again want to want to reemphasize that the the other thing is as long as we're talking psychedelics and hallucinogens we should probably just touch on MDMA for a moment first of all MDMA ecstasy um has a number of challenges or potential problems that need to be highlighted first of all um contaminants you know we have a fentanyl crisis in the US so contaminants so Purity is essential second of all it is methylene dioxy methampetamine and the methamphetamine part often gets people thinking like whoa it seems however that the inclusion of the methylene dioxy component increases serotonin dramatically and it is the increase in serotonin perhaps or at least it's now thought in addition to the increase in dopamine caused by the methampetamine component combined that provides some sort of neuroprotective effect the early reports that MDMA ecstasy is neurotoxic quote unquote puts holes in your brain was flawed by and indeed that paper was retracted the researchers did that study in Earnest but then later discovered that when they reached for the MDMA on the Shelf they actually grabbed the methamphetamine but the news agencies didn't report that retraction now our best evidence that MDMA taken in the appropriate clinically supported context can act as an empathogen can help people develop empathy for themselves and help relieve trauma and indeed the clinical trials show that at the proper dosing and the proper frequency with the proper support there's up to 60% and as high as 67% remission of PTSD remarkable with support okay not just taking Molly and like dancing in the desert we're talking about we're talking about in the eye mask we're talking about going inward we're talking about relaying your experience we're talking about talking about the challenging experience or experiences with someone who's qualified to help you deal with all of that Etc and someone to drive you home because you feel like a puddle afterwards talking about all of that we're not talking about eye gazing with your partner telling them how much you love them you're talking about empathy for self love for self which is a concept that frankly I've often struggled with I thought you know people would say you got to love yourself I'm like what is that like what is that I love my Bulldog I love my friends I love cuttlefish but like what is that and I think through the use of MDMA you can there seems to be this ability to develop imp pathogenic states to yourself but of course the reason for the clinical trials insisting that people stay in the IM askk and communicate their experience maybe popping out of it every once in a while and talking with somebody in a trusted sort a trusted person in a way that can be helpful towards dealing with the trauma is that the problem with having that much serotonin and that much dopamine in your system is that you can become empathic toward anything so we've all known people that take MDMA listen to a particular soundtrack and they're like I'm going to become a musician I love music and again I'm not recommending anyone do MDMA but in recent years I've really changed my stance on psychedelics 5 years ago 10 years ago I never would have had this discussion certainly not with a microphone in front of my face anything being recorded would have worried about losing my job at Stanford or elsewhere but we now have many Laboratories at Stanford and elsewhere that are doing work that is federally funded on these compounds and if you think about these compounds while they have been used recreationally are simply ways to adjust levels of neuromodulators in the brain serotonin dopamine Etc that's really all they are although they do it very potently and therefore caution needs to be applied and as long as we're on that topic I should mention that ketamine everyone's excited about ketamine when I was growing up I was taught that there's a compound that's really dangerous it's called PCP ven cycline they are the same compound they don't tell you this ketamine and PCP same thing and I learned about PCP as the compound that was going to make criminals like punch light poles and beat up 12 cops and yeah I watched too much chips when I was growing up for those of you old old enough to remember is like Ponch and John they the motorcycles with the shorts my sister watched it too but for completely different reasons so PCP was like this demonized drug but ketamine and all this stuff about ketamine is now legal in the US I don't know its status here in Sydney so I'll see if I get arrested on the way out but you know ketamine is potentially addictive people talk about the khole ETC weird name by the way um the whole business with ketamine is again it's a potent MDMA n methylaspartate blocker which blocks neuroplasticity in the short term expands it in the long term so the way to think about these compounds these drugs is by way of their mechanism and so it should be no surprise that they're able to induce neuroplasticity but the goal is not plasticity this is very very important the goal goal is not plasticity the goal is plasticity directed toward a particular positive outcome anytime you have plasticity you have the potential for maladaptive plasticity as well and so that's an additional cautionary note as I often say on the podcast I don't say that just to protect me although I am a little bit worried now about what I just said over the last five minutes I'm say that to protect you next question before I get myself in trouble what about what DMT yeah dimethyl trip to me the yeah it leads to less uh to um lower threshold for impulsivity like screaming out what about DMT just kidding I don't sorry um so I'm just joking I'm just joking you seem like you could take it so I got yeah so um so I've never done DMT but I've heard it's a highspeed freight train into your Consciousness behind the circuit board and Back Again um so there are a few great studies on DMT in iasa just as long as we're expanding into the the full trip down to the Jungle um and the the data are interesting it's it's harder to know what's going on in these very short trip massive neuromodulator release um uh type drug scenarios um Robin Card Harris at the University of California San Francisco is somebody who's looking at DMT um more extensively and and I I don't want to avoid giving you an answer but I I do want to avoid giving you a wrong answer that's not informed one thing I'll say and this is just rarely do I plug anything related to the podcast but we we are actually providing some support to Robin and others laboratory for the study of things like DMT one of the things that we do at the podcast and this is not a request for anything we do take a significant portion of the proceeds from our premium channel and we fund studies of exciting things like DMT we're supporting Robin's lab this coming year I've pulled together some other donors to provide support for all human studies no animal studies and the goal is really to fill in important blanks like the study of DMT um as well as other things we're we're currently funding the um Eating Disorders laboratory at the at Columbia University Eating Disorders by the way um anorexia nervosa in particular the most deadly of all psychiatric disorders a really um tragic challenge there um so I just mentioned that getting funding for science on really um kind of Next Level stuff is hard for reasons that are would take up the whole night so that's one thing that I'm really trying to do in the next few years and again this is not a request but to you know pull together donors and get them to give money to Laboratories to do the kind of stuff that's going to feed back to the general public very quickly because I think we're all getting a little tired of the like okay Mouse study which are great you know but in 10 years this might lead to a blank for Alzheimer's or blank for autism I think we're all getting a little tired of that narrative so we're trying to accelerate the process okay the yeah thank you the um and it's not a sole effort it's just I do happen to know a lot about the way that funding me mechanisms can get a little bit clogged and so just trying to you know clear some of those clogs um the brain and gut axis is this a thing it is most definitely a thing so I think one of the more exciting areas is the so-called gut brain axis we all now here about the gut microbiome I must say down here y'all are really evolved in this Dimension the other day I noticed probably from jet lag and travel and I don't know maybe I swam in some stuff that had too much chlorine or something I was getting like some little like skin thing on my face I was like all right I'll go go get some triple antibiotic ointment like I do back home clean it up because I forgot mine so I go to the pharmacy here what you call the chemist I go to the pharmacy and and the guy behind the counter says well you don't first of all you can't get triple antibiotic ointment here you need a prescription like all right well this is going to get tricky now I got to forge a prescription and and I'm just kidding don't do that don't do that um and he says but you know have you considered whether or not maybe your skin microbiome is struggling because of the lack of sleep the jetl and maybe you were exposed to some chlorine or something I thought you know that's a logical way to think about it cuz cuz we just did an episode on oral health where I'm telling everybody hey like avoid these like high alcohol astringent mouthwashes that kill your oral microbiome because all the dentists and periodontists are telling me yeah they'll make your breath fresh but actually it's Wrecking your gut microbiome and it's bad for so I take the probiotic you guys have amazing probiotics here and in a day boom it's done now I didn't do a control clinical trial I don't know whether or not that was really what did it but it's an interesting idea this I we know for instance that we have a distinct microbiome niches different bacteria that live in our nasal passages on the surface of our eyes on the surface of our skin in the urethra in essentially every orifice mucus membrane but everywhere in and around our body and that these little microbiota are provided they are supported they do many things but among them the gut microbiome which of course start in the mouth as the oral health episode um describes with a lot of protocols as well the the gut microbiome when it's well supported creates certain fatty acids that are the precursors or catalysts for the production of certain neurotransmitters in the brain and it is now oh so clear that enhancing the diversity of Flora of microbiota in the gut and mouth is great for the nervous system so much so that some of the studies on on relief from certain neuros psychiatric conditions are being achieved through and I know it's not pleasant but microbiota transfer between individuals socalled fecal transplants which always makes me a little bit uncomfortable to think about never had one but you know it's pretty interesting you know despite the discomfort of thinking about that process at least for me the the whole business of taking the gut microbiota from one individual that's not suffering from something and putting it into another individual and seeing Rel from certain symptoms of given conditions is really compelling so I think that we should all be thinking about ways to support our gut brain AIS it's very clear that the best lowcost no supplement way to do that is going to be to consume one to four servings of some fermented food no beer doesn't count low sugar fermented foods I suppose beer does count but it comes with some other issues um such as you know kimch or Sauer krauts or kefir or you know every culture seems to have its own uh probiotic Prebiotic foods and that's going to be the best way and it's clear that it has immense benefit and then when you don't have access to those Foods doing things like taking a pill probiotic now and again is probably not a bad idea if you're traveling or you're sleep deprived the the the challenge with that sort of thing is that it's a generalized effect of supporting multiple systems in the brain and body body so it's going to be a long time maybe never before you see a really nice clean study that says that okay increasing the amount of lactobacillus in the gut by taking you know X number of milligrams of lactobacillus improves your cognition you're not going to find that study why because in science it's important and in health to distinguish between moderating effects and mediating effects lots of things can moderate a given feature of your brain or health so for instance if uh you know God forbid a fire alarm went off tonight it would moderate our tension or excuse me modulate modulate Kies in California now I'm saying moderate modulate your attention but it doesn't mediate attention on a normal basis you know the fire alarm isn't involved in your attention whereas certain other things mediate those mechanisms of attention so when you improve sleep you're going to see positive effects on any number of things when you sleep deprive people you're going to see deficit in any number of things these are not Direct effects these are indirect effects likewise with the microbiome so I think gut microbiome sits in the various what I call pillars of mental health physical health and performance these are the things that we should try and tend to on a regular basis to give buoyancy to our mental health physical health and performance but I wouldn't get too caught up in wondering which exact microbiota are important I think diversity of the microbiome is key if you're taking antibiotics you want to do something to counter that through pill probiotics Etc and and certainly antibiotics aren't bad but the overuse of antibiotics um certainly can be and um good on you for having uh chemists that know better than to just hand me a bottle of triple antibiotic ointment quality of sleep going to bed early compared to sleeping late but still for eight hours depends depends on whether or not your chronotype which for a long time I did not think was real but based on newer data it's absolutely clear our real whether or not you feel best going to bed early waking up early we're going to bed at a more typical time of 10: p.m. to say wake up or 11:00 p.m. and waking up at 7:00 a.m. I see that you know for any folks leaving they like early to bed right I get it I'm not offended it's fine the um I get it it would not be the first time that people uh I always say if nothing else the podcast will cure insomnia because the episodes are very very long um you know for some people they just feel spectacularly better going to sleep early and waking up early spectacularly better I'm one such person other people feel much better staying up late waking up late the total duration of sleep is important the regularity of sleep it turns out is becoming a very important variable or it has always been an important variable but the data are pointing to the fact that if you are somebody who feels best going to sleep around 11:00 p.m. and waking up at 7:00 a.m. trying to keep that to bedtime within plus or minus 1 hour anytime you can except on a time and on night when there's a lecture at the ICC theater is a good idea but in general five nights out of the week you want to go to sleep within plus or minus an hour of the same bedtime that's kind of the general goal and in the Sleep series with Matt Walker he talks about the quality quantity regularity and timing qqr T quantity quality regularity and timing of your sleep being the four key features of your sleep to try and dial in but of course life isn't about optimizing everything it's good to get out and party every once in a while stay up all watch the sunrise and just live life also so I think sometimes people get the impression because I wear the same shirt all the time that I do everything in a hyper regimented way but actually it's quite the opposite I try and do things regularly and as consistently as possible so that deviations from those protocols don't impact me negatively much at all that's the idea I have ADHD and I'm struggling to focus what would be the best way to go about regaining my focus Nick okay so I think that nowadays many many people people struggle with um issues with Focus I think we have our dos and our do Nots and I'm obviously not a psychiatrist and I can't diagnose you Nick from a question on a on a slide but there I just want to start off by saying that there are indeed people who truly struggle with Focus to the extent that they have clinically diagnosable ADHD and I've did two episodes on ADHD and focus one that was mainly focused on behavioral tools and nutrition and to some extent supplementation and when I put out that episode about half of the comments out there were how could you you don't respect modern science you have no um Integrity how could you suggest that people use these tools it's all about prescription drugs and the other half were like yes finally some tools and some acknowledgement that these things actually matter and can help maybe even in conjunction with pharmaceutical AIDS and then we did a second episode which is about the prescription drugs and it was the exact reverse people writing to me in droves saying thank you so much I've been prescribing these drugs or I've been giving these prescription drugs to my child rather it's really been helping but I'm embarrassed to tell everybody because then people demonize me and tell me I'm poisoning my kid that they're on meth and then the other half saying how could you the pharmaceutical industry big Pharma is out to get us all I must say that um and I'm happy to be in this role um or not happy but I'm willing to be in the role of try and cover it all and give people options I don't tell people what to do I don't prescribe anything I profess many many things and you should do is you decide is best for you but just know what you're doing and here's the deal that drugs like adderal viant Etc are indeed amphetamines that's true um in the young brain they can help enhance some of the neurom modulators that allow for elevated activity in areas like the prefrontal cortex and elsewhere that allow for more focused attention and less impuls ity because the main function of the prefrontal cortex as you may all recall is to say to the particular areas of the brain that want to move or cause us to move or cause us to blurt things out like DMT or whatever it is and sorry I didn't mean to pick on you I we'll do DMT together we'll do some MDMA also and then we'll like be we like we heart heart medicine um so the reality is that there are neurochemical tools that can help help with ADHD but there are also behavioral tools and in countries outside of the US namely in China there are extensive efforts to train young people to focus for longer periods of time and believe it or not they're not doing that through any D at least in these experiments through any Draconian approach they actually have them do what they have them focus on visual targets the longer you focus on a visual Target we know the longer you bring about the activation of certain neural circuit in the brain that allow for better focus and while not everything is about Vision it is certainly the case based on those studies and the data I've looked at them quite extensively that even a short period of time of learning to entrain one's focus on a fixation points this would be the Virgin side movement this is the Cuttlefish ready to eat or mate not the Cuttlefish swimming around looking for potential predators in panoramic mode doing that for a short period of time of even a minute or 3 minutes can allow one to bring online the neural circuits that allow for enhanced focus in the subsequent 10 to 20 minutes which is a pretty reasonable bout of work if you think about it and here's another important Point none of us none of us ADHD sufferers or otherwise should expect ourselves to be in perfect trenches deep trenches of focus all the time that's an unreasonable request for your nervous system you can build up a capacity to focus and of course we can all Focus best on things that we really enjoy in fact children and adults with ADHD are known to have tremendous focusing capacity if they're focusing on something they really enjoy this has been shown over and over again which means that the capacity to focus is there it's just that the threshold to focus is higher which means that it's harder to access and these visual fixation they're not even experiments you can literally just place a visual Target on the wall you know one to three feet away force yourself to stare at that visual Focus point and then move into your work and you'll notice that your mind will flit away from whatever it is you're trying to focus on but with some training you can build up an enhanced capacity to focus it does require you flip your phone over you turn it off you leave it in the other room you remove distractions some people even find children will find if they wear a brimmed hat and a hoodie which basically took me through most of high school for other reasons if you do that you can create a more narrow tunnel of vision this is the reason they put blinders on horses so it sounds somewhat um medieval it some sounds somewhat primitive or crude but once again again what we're really talking about is removing the expectation that focus is like a square wave function where you know you you sit down you open your book and boom you're focused I mean you wouldn't expect that of physical performance would you there's a warm-up there's some Dynamic stretching there's perhaps some just getting your mind in the groove you know this sort of thing neural circuits are not onof it's not a square wave function takes some time to ease into a motive focus and so um my suggest question Nick is that you and others that struggle with Focus think about the do Nots the distractions that clearly are intervening in our ability to focus nowadays but also as you think about the things to explore which may include these pharmaceutical tools of course prescribed by a licensed physician but that you consider that perhaps the expectations that you're placing on yourself to focus are too immediate and that you should train these up more gradually over time which is not to say that you should settle on having limited Focus but that this is a skill that you can develop like any other skill that your nervous system is capable of plasticity throughout the lifespan we absolutely know that and given that uh I'm presuming I don't know why I'm presuming that you're a young person but even if you're not that you can increase your ability to access these narrow trenches of focus even for things that don't Delight you but I hope you are you are also doing some things that Delight you so I was told that's the final question I'm going to take that very seriously um and somewhat unfortunately for me because I could go all night um really enjoyed tonight thank you very much thank you thank you so much I just thank you thanks so much thank you truly thank you I really uh appreciate this opportunity to connect with you all thanks for coming out the fact that people come out to listen to a bunch of Science and uh and uh Health discussion is greatly appreciated you know all the tools all the protocols all the mechanisms all the information while some of it a very very small fraction of it was was developed or discovered in my laboratory virtually everything that I cover on the podcast I've talked about tonight are the great discoveries of other people who deserve the credit and I've tried to give credit where where um where credit is due the most important thing to me of course is that um as you each learn and try these different tools and protocols as you see fit for you that it would be wonderful if you'd pass them on to other people um please please please remove my name from that passage this is not about me or the podcast it's really about um the one uh thing we know to certainly be true about our species is that we can communicate information to one another handoff tools and that um in the case where these tools can help relieve suffering wonderful in the case where these tools can help improve mental health physical health and performance we uh we need to I believe and and should do that for one another and last but certainly not least thank you for your interest in science [Applause] [Music]
